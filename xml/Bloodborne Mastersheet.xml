<weapons>Weapons:
Hunter Axe: One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly
used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt.

Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers wider
palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy


         
                                                                                    <page n="36"></page>


blunt attack, leading to high rally potential.

No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts.
Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner.

Saw Cleaver: One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly
used in the hunting business.

This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts,
transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of
centrifugal force.

The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become
a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness
the more grotesquely transformed the beast.

Saw Spear: One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly
used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt.

This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts,
transforms into a medium-range spear.

The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become
a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness
the more grotesquely transformed the beast.

Threaded Cane: One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used
by hunters on their duties.

Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as
a whip when its blade is split into many.

Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the
beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an
attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the
hunt will never encroach upon the soul.

Kirkhammer: A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters.

On the one side, an easily handled silver sword.


         
                                                                                        <page n="37"></page>


On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized
by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact.

The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance
toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon.

Rifle Spear: A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs.

A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and
spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon.

Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only
trick weapon with an attached gun.

Stake Driver: A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics,
the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura.

The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently
drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes.

The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but
is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none
of this should bother a mere Powder Keg.

Ludwig’s Holy Blade: A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters.

It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig,
the first hunter of the church. When transformed,
it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword.

It exhibits several departures from the workshop's
design, suggesting that the Church anticipated
much larger inhuman beasts.

Blade of Mercy: A special trick weapon passed down among
hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons
of the workshop.

Splits into two when activated. The weapon's
warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral


        
                                                                                   <page n="38"></page>


of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,
such as after a quick-stepping.

Tonitrus: A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous
eccentric of the Healing Church workshop.

Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match
generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast.

Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's
time did not fully take to the device.

Chikage: Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who
protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst
Castle.

When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the
Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in
scarlet hues.

However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence.

Reiterpallash: Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst.

Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar
firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order.

The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers
to the sanguine plague,and the disposal of beasts was a
discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were
called for the sake of appearances.

Logarius’ Wheel: Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners.

Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in
pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire.

Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest
their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance.



        
                                                                                   <page n="39"></page>


Burial Blade: Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter.

A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons
crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite,
said to have fallen from the heavens.

Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing
only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken
to another harrowing nightmare.

Beast Claw: Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.

Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast
and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive,
and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly
power.

As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within
awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with
both strength and feverish reverie.

Amygdalan Arm: The arm of a small Amygdala Great One.

Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of
any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs.

Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but
when extended, the arm quivers as if it were still alive.

Beasthunter Saif: A trick weapon used by the old hunters.

A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In
its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved
sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted,
allowing for quick, repeated stabs.

Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it
was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were
more effective at disposing of beasts.



        
                                                                                   <page n="40"></page>


Beast Cutter: A trick weapon wielded by the old hunters.

This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast
hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections,
allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip.

The crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably
inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters
made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine blacks and
reds.

Bloodletter: The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador,
the Healing Church assassin.

The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it
draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and
soul.

This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or
so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe.

Boom Hammer: A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the
workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs.

A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When
ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes
furiously upon impact.

Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the
Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute
distaste for beasts.

Church Pick: One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a
hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that
appears in the old beast tales.

The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when
transformed, functions as an extended war pick. In spite of
its origins, it is a highly practical weapon.



        
                                                                                   <page n="41"></page>


Holy Moonlight Sword: An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig.
When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it
channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave.
The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the
Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade,
and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a
very private, elusive sort.

Kos Parasite: When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides
were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in
humans.

This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung,
but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting
a lumenwood.

Rakuyo: Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral
Clocktower.

A trick sword originated in the same country as the
Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but
instead demands great dexterity.

Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she
frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative
of the queen.

One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into
a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer.

Simon’s Bowblade: Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church
hunters.

Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had
this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade
serves as a bow when transformed.

But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for
his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with
a measly bow?


        
                                                                                   <page n="42"></page>


Whirligig Saw: A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the
Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice for the old hunter Valtr,
the Beast Eater.

This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true
strength lies in its attached mechanical saws.
These discs, lined with serrated teeth, spin rapidly, trashing
the flesh of beasts into fine shreds.

Hunter Blunderbuss: A blunderbuss created at the workshop for the hunters'
line of work.

Hunter firearms are specially crafted to employ Quicksilver
Bullets fused with the wielder's own blood, boosting damage
against beasts.

The impact of this highly-effective weapon counters beasts'
swift movements, and its wide spread is nigh-on guaranteed
to hit the mark.

Hunter Pistol: Pistol made at the workshop, for hunters stalking beasts.

Hunter firearms are specially crafted to employ
Quicksilver Bullets fused with the wielder's own blood,
boosting damage against beasts.

The pistol is a quicker draw than the blunderbuss,
allowing for speedier responses to attacks.

Flamesprayer: A special weapon used by certain members of the Healing
Church.
Spits searing flames by using blood-imbued Quicksilver
Bullets as a special medium.

Not the most efficient weapon by any stretch, but sometimes
a sea of flame is just what the doctor ordered.

Besides, the beasts of Yharnam can always use a good
cleansing.



        
                                                                                   <page n="43"></page>


Repeating Pistol: Repeating pistol typically used by Healing Church hunters.

Crafted with mostly metal parts and exhibiting a complex design,
the repeating pistol fires two shots at once,
making it a ravenous consumer of Quicksilver Bullets.

Should be used sparingly compared to its workshop counterpart,
as the trump card in one's arsenal.

Cannon: Large prototype firearms fashioned by the workshop
heretics, the Powder Kegs.

Use of this weapon is equivalent to toting a mounted
cannon, complete with its ridiculous weight, staggering
kick, and lavish use of Quicksilver Bullets, into battle.

Such a monstrosity was doomed from the start, and
indeed its development was cut short. Yet, against
impossibly gigantic foes, it might be just the thing.

Ludwig’s Rifle: A rifle typically used by Healing Church hunters.

It is said that this rifle was employed by Ludwig,
the first hunter of the Church. Its long, heavy barrel
makes up in range for what it lacks in reload speed.

Ludwig's Rifle exhibits several departures from the
workshop's design, suggesting that the Church
anticipated much larger inhuman beasts.

Evelyn: Special pistol used by Cainhurst knights.

The Evelyn uses Quicksilver Bullets, just as any workshop
firearm, but the Cainhurst variant relies more on bloodtinge.

Lovingly named after a woman and graced with an intricate
design, Evelyns were adored by Cainhurst knights.




        
                                                                                   <page n="44"></page>


Rosmarinus: A special weapon used by the Choir, high-ranking
members of the Healing Church.

Sprays a cloud of sacred mist, created by using
blood-imbued Quicksilver Bullets as a special medium.

Arias are heard wherever sacred mist is seen, proving
that the mist is a heavenly blessing.

"Oh, fair maiden, why is it that you weep?"

Church Cannon: An oversized weapon used by the Healing Church. a type of
cannon that fires with a curved trajectory and creates an
explosion upon impact.

Originally designed for use by brawny men with deteriorated
brains, not for just any ordinary hunter.

But the men lacked the wits to effectively operate firearms,
and the weapon was quietly ushered into permanent storage.

Fist of Gratia: A chunk of iron fitted with finger holes.

The hulking hunter woman Simple Gratia, ever hopeless
when handling hunter firearms, preferred to knock the lights
out of the beasts with this hunk of iron, which incidentally
caused heavy stagger.

Gratia was a fearsome hunter, and to onlookers, her
unrelenting pummeling appeared oddly heroic. No wonder
the weapon later assumed her name.

Piercing Rifle: A rifle engineered by the Oto Workshop, the precursor to
the workshop of the heretical Powder Kegs.

Designed for hunting on narrow streets, this rifle has been
optimized to cause perforation wounds, but is unfit for
reliably countering attacks.




        
                                                                                   <page n="45"></page>


Gatling Gun: This is a highly-customised, portable version of the
stationary gatling gun operated by the old hunter Djura in
Old Yharnam. It was the weapon of choice of the youngest
of Djura's three companions.

The Gatling Gun boasts exceptional rapid-firing
functionality, but is considered a cumbersome weapon, due
to its excessive weight and insatiable consumption of
Quicksilver Bullets.

Wooden Shield: A crude weapon shield used by the masses who have
arisen to join the hunt.

Hunters do not normally employ shields, ineffectual
against the strength of the beasts as they tend to be.

Shield are nice, but not if they engender passivity.

Hunter’s Torch: A torch formed by wrapping a pine resin-drenched cloth
around the end of a long stick. Once used in Old Yharnam.

Designed to incinerate beasts and victims touched by the
scourge.

Its fire damage is highly effective against beasts.

Torch: A common torch formed by wrapping a pine resin-drenched
cloth around the end of a long stick.

Hunters choose torches not only because the hunt leads
them to the darkest nooks, but also because certain creatures
they encounter are possessed of a deathly fear of flame.

Loch Shield: An artisanal shield crafted with blue glass.

Originally used to safeguard the leader presiding over a
sacred Healing Church ceremony, and later supplied to tomb
prospectors, in particular those exploring the labyrinth of
Isz.



        
                                                                                  
<page n="46"></page>


The blue is fashioned after a lake, and the shield greatly
reduces all forms of non-physical damage. </weapons>

human. Seek deadlier foes if bloodstone chunks are needed.

Blood Rock: A large solid chunk that forms in coldblood.

After death, a substance in the blood hardens, and that
which does not crystallise is called a blood stone.

This is no mere chunk, it is nearly a boulder.

Few blood stones of such size have ever been discovered,
even considering the combined experience of all the hunters.




        
                                                                                               <page n="47"></page>

borderlines on mania, and exudes a slight warmth.

Gold Ardeo: The odd helmet worn by the band of Executioners commanded by the martyr
Logarius. The conical gold helmet, symbol of the executioners, represents luminosity, ambition,
and an unflagging resolve to face impurity, staring it down with stern, golden spirit. As the great


        
                                                                                              <page n="52"></page>


Logarius once said, "Acts of goodness are not always wise, and acts of evil are not always
foolish, but regardless, we shall always strive to be good."

Executioner Garb: Attire worn by the band of executioners commanded by the martyr
Logarius. Later became that basis for all Church attire, with its heavy draping of Holy Shawl. As
the great Logarius once said, "Acts of goodness are not always wise, and acts of evil are not
always foolish, but regardless, we shall always strive to be good."

Executioner Gloves: Gauntlets worn by the band of executioners commanded by the martyr
Logarius. The brass rivets are unique to the executioners, and reflect their adoration of hand-to-
hand combat. As the great Logarius once said, "Acts of goodness are not always wise, and acts
of evil are not always foolish, but regardless, we shall always strive to be good."

Executioner Trousers: Attire worn by the band of executioners commanded by the martyr
Logarius. Later became that basis for all Church attire. As the great Logarius once said, "Acts of
goodness are not always wise, and acts of evil are not always foolish, but regardless, we shall

Black Hood: Hood worn upon awakening to the nightmare of blood and beasts. Perhaps its
wearer had to stay out of sight, and travel by cover of darkness. Without memory, who will ever
know?

Foreign Garb: Clothing worn upon awakening to the nightmare of blood and beasts. Not typical
clothing of Yharnam, perhaps it is of foreign origin, It is said, after all, the traveler came to
Yharnam from afar. Without memory, who will ever know?

Sullied Bandage: Bandage worn upon awakening to the nightmare of blood and beasts. Terribly
worn and unsanitary. A faint memory recalls blood ministration, involving the transfusion of
unknown blood. Not long after, the nightmare began.

Foreign Trousers: Trousers worn upon awakening to the nightmare of blood and beasts. Not
typical clothing perhaps it is of foreign origin. It is said, after all, the traveler came to Yharnam
from afar. Without memory, who will ever know?

Gascoigne’s Set: Hunter attire worn by Father Gascoigne. Similar to the hunter garb created at
the workshop, only these are tainted by a pungent beastly stench that eats away at Gascoigne.
"Father" is a title used for clerics in a foreign land, and there is no such rank in the Healing
Church.




        
                                                                                           <page n="53"></page>

is a title used for clerics in a foreign land, and there is no such rank in the Healing Church.

Gehrman’s Set: Hunter attire of Gehrman, the first hunter. Created before the workshop existed
by making adjustments to everyday clothing, and later became the basis for all hunter's garb. The
hunter's emphasis on engaging beasts with speed, and therefore of selecting lightweight attire, no
doubt traces back to Gehrman's own combat style.

Graveguard Mask: Mask of Dores, graveguard of the Forbidden Woods. His pale countenance
mimics the labyrinth watchers. Willem kept two loyal servants back at Byrgenwerth. When they
were sent into the labyrinth, they encountered the eldritch Truth, and went mad. One became the
password gatekeeper, while Dores became a graveguard of the forest. Both remained loyal, even
in madness.

Graveguard Robe: Robe of Dores, graveguard of the Forbidden Woods. Countless bloodied
ritual tools hang from its back. Willem kept two loyal servants back at Byrgenwerth. When they

in the blood of untidy rituals. Willem kept two loyal servants back at Byrgenwerth. When they

blood of untidy rituals. Willem kept two loyal servants back at Byrgenwerth. When they were

Henryk’s Hunter Cap: Hunter's hat worn by Henryk, the old hunter. The taciturn old hunter
Henryk was once partners with Father Gascoigne, and though they were a fierce and gallant duo,
their partnership led to Henryk's tragically long life. Henryk's unique yellow garb is resistant to
bolt and will be of great help to any hunter who has inherited the onus of the hunt.

Cape Hunter Set: One of the standard articles of hunter attire fashioned at the workshop. A fine
piece of hunter attire that provides stable defence to anyone facing Yharnam's beastly threat.
Allows one to stalk beats unannounced, by cover of night.

Charred Hunter Garb: One of the staple articles of hunter attire, fashioned at the workshop. A
product of the scourge of the beast that once plagued Old Yharnam and culminated in the town's
fiery cleansing. The cape's dampness makes it highly resistant to fire. Wearers of this attire
hunted down victims of the scourge who survived the raging flames and stench of singed blood.

Blindfold Cap: Attire of the Choir, high-ranking members of the Healing Church. Members of
the Choir are both the highest-ranking clerics of the Healing Church, and scholars who continue
the work that began at Byrgenwerth. The eye covering indicates their debt to the teachings of

Knight’s Wig: Adornment prized by the knights of Cainhurst. Resembles a ponytail of silver
hair. The Cainhurst way is a mix of nostalgia and bombast. They take great pride even in the
blood-stained corpses of beasts that they leave behind, confident that they will stand as example
of decadent art.

Knight’s Garb: Attire of the knights of Cainhurst. A regal piece graced by intricate goldwork.

Madman Hood: Most tomb prospectors, members of the Healing Church chose to explore the
old labyrinth, are unable to withstand the weight of the old knowledge, and go mad. This attire is
worn by those lost souls. Truth often resembles madness, inaccessible to the dull of mind. Those
who go mad are merely thoughtful souls who failed to reach any conclusions.

Madman Garb: Most tomb prospectors, members of the Healing Church chose to explore the
old labyrinth, are unable to withstand the weight of the old knowledge, and go mad. This attire is
worn by those lost souls. The appendages draped across them are said to be a kind of protective
charm, or at least, that is what these lost souls believe with all their hearts.

Cape Student Uniform: Uniform of the students of Byrgenwerth, a bygone institute of learning.
Features a thick cape. The Healing Church has its roots in Byrgenwerth, and naturally borrows
heavily from its uniform design. The focus not on knowledge, or thought, but on pure pretension
would surely bring Master Willem to despair, if only he knew.

Student Uniform: Uniform of the students of Byrgenwerth, a bygone institute learning. This
alternative lacks the thick cape. This Healing Church has its roots in Byrgenwerth, and naturally
borrows heavily from its uniform design. The focus not on knowledge, or thought, but on pure
pretension would surely bring Master Willem to despair, if only he knew.

Tomb Prospector Set: Attire of tomb prospectors who explore the old labyrinth on behalf of the
Healing Church. The Healing Church traces its roots to Byrgenwerth, and is therefore aware of
the ruins' true importance. They contain much more than mere hunter trinkets, indeed, they hide
the very secrets of the old Great Ones, sought after by those with the insight to imagine
greatness.

Top Hat: Hat worn by hunters who admire formality. Some hunters place an emphasis on form,
as seen by the use of the threaded cane. For them, formality, beauty, and justice are the very
essence of our humanity, and precisely what keeps hunters from becoming something else.

White Church Set: Attire of special Church doctors. These doctors are superiors to the black
preventative hunters, and specialists in experimentally-backed blood ministration and the
scourge of the beast. They believe that medicine is not a means of treatment but rather a method
for research, and that some knowledge can only be obtained by exposing oneself to sickness.

Black Hooded Iron Helm: Iron helmet worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. The hunters of
Yahar'gul answer to the village's founders, the School of Mensis. Hunters in name only, these
kidnappers wear their black hoods low to shadow their eyes. This helm is made of metal, a rarity
for hunter garb, and has high defence, but only against physical attacks.

Iron Yahar’gul Helm: Iron helmet worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. Removing the hood
reveals something reminiscent of a warrior of a previous age. This headwear is made of metal, a
rarity for hunter garb, and has high defense, but only against physical attacks.




        
                                                                                            <page n="57"></page>


Yahar’gul Black Garb: Thick black pullover worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. The
hunters of Yahar'gul answer to the village's founders, the School of Mensis. Hunters in name
only, these kidnappers blend into the night wearing this attire. Designed primarily to defend from
physical attacks, the binding of thick rope serves both to protect its wearer, and restrain his foes.

Yahar’gul Black Gloves: Thick black gloves worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. The
hunters of Yahar'gul answer to the village's founders, the School of Mensis. Hunters in name
only, these kidnappers blend into the night wearing this attire. Designed primarily to defend from
physical attacks.

Yahar’gul Black Trousers: Thick black trousers worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. The
hunters of Yahar'gul answer to the village's founders, the School of Mensis. Hunters in name
only, these kidnappers blend into the night wearing this attire. Designed primarily to defend from
physical attacks.

Yharnam Hunter Set: Ludwig, the first hunter of the Healing Church, once recruited
Yharnamites to serve as hunters. This hunter's attire was made for new recruits, and has excellent
straightforward defense. But not nearly enough to allow an ordinary man to stand any real
chance against the beasts.

Brador’s Testimony: The scalp of a horrid cleric beast, indicating that hunter Brador, a Healing
Church assassin, had killed a compatriot. Afterward, he wore his ally's own scalp, and hid
himself away, deep below in a cell. The Church provided him with a single, soundless bell of
death, to ensure their secrets would be kept.

Beast Hide Garb: The bloodied hide of a horrible cleric beast, pulled over the back. Without the
attacked beast hide this foreigner garb wouldn't raise anyone's eyebrows. Brador donned a
compatriot's beastly scalp and hide while still moist with blood. Most of the blood stains on this
hide were from that day.

Bloodied Arm Bands: Bloodied arm bands. Brador donned a compatriot's beastly scalp and hide
while still moist with blood. Most of the blood stains on this hide were from that day.

Bloodied Trousers: Bloodied foreign trousers. Brador donned a compatriot's beastly scalp and
hid while still moist with blood. Most of the blood stains on this hide were from that day.

Butcher Mask: Mask of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods, likely belonging
to the older of the two. The twins grew up in silent kinship with a poisonous snake. Eventually
they learned human ways, and became hunters. When they discovered vermin even in their
beloved snake, the younger brother is said to have murdered the older.


        
                                                                                           <page n="58"></page>


Butcher Garb: Garb of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods, likely belonging
to the older of the two. Both the twins became hunters, and brought back and dissected their
beast prey, in order to support the villagers in their forbidden research.

Butcher Gloves: Gloves of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods, likely
belonging to the older of the two. Both the twins became hunters, and brought back and dissected
their beast prey, in order to support the villagers in their forbidden research.

belonging to the older of the two. Both the twins became hunters, and brought back and dissected
their beast prey, in order to support the villagers in their forbidden research.

One-eyed Iron Helm: An iron helm resembling an upside-down bucket. A single hole allows
one to peek out with a single eye, which is probably all that its original owner had.

Master’s Iron Helm: An iron helm resembling an upside-down bucket. A single hole allows
one to peek out with a single eye, which is probably all that its original owner had. The iron helm
is passed down among masters of the League. Valtr had in fact lost the ability to see vermin long
ago.

Constable Set: Once upon a time, a troupe of foreign constables chased a beast all the way to
Yharnam, and this is what they wore. The constables became victims of the beast, except for one
survivor, who in turn devoured the creature whole, all by himself. The fable is a favorite among
Yharnamites, who are partial to any stories of pompous, intolerant foreigners who suffer for their
ignorance. It makes the blood taste that much sweeter.

Decorative Old Hunter Set: Old hunter garb decorated with brass trinkets. At the time, some
hunters believed that certain metals would ward off beast blood. On a night of the hunt, it is no
wonder that people would resort to superstition.

Old Hunter Cap: Old Hunter Cap with a wide brim that hides their sharp gaze. In the old days,
when hunters were ten a penny, this was part of their standard garb.

Old Hunter Top Hat: Old hunter top hat, warped by blood stains. In the old days, when hunters
were ten a penny, this was part of their standard garb.

Old Hunter Garb: Old hunter garb. One day, the hunters disappeared, and Yharnamites began
to whisper of the hunters' sin. Drunk with blood, chasing after beasts, they would pass on to the
Nightmare, every last one of them.



        
                                                                                            <page n="59"></page>


Old Hunter Gloves: Old hunter gauntlets made of brass to protect their weapon-bearing hands.
At the time, some hunters believed that certain metals would ward off beast blood. On a night of
the hunt, it is no wonder that people would resort to superstition.

Old Hunter Trousers: Old hunter trousers that protected countless hunters from the beasts in an
older age. A widespread belief of the period was that "beast blood crept up the right leg," and
this led to the double-wrapped belt.

Harrowed Set: Certain Church hunters obfuscate their identities and slip into the nooks and
crannies of the city. This is the garb that allows these harrowed individuals to go unnoticed.
These hunters are keen to early signs of the scourge, serving as a first line of defense against its
outbreak. Or perhaps, when the time is ripe, they find signs of the scourge where there are none.
It just goes to show, the corner beggar is not always who he seems.

Lady Maria’s Set: Among the first hunters, all students of Gehrman, was the lady hunter Maria.
This was her hunter's cap, crafted in Cainhurst. Maria is distantly related to the undead queen,
but had great admiration for Gehrman, unaware of his curious mania.

Yamamura Hunter Hat: A standard hunter's hat, worn by Yamamura the Wanderer. This hat
and staff were given to him when he became a hunter and confederate of the League.

Khaki Haori: Garb of a distant Eastern land, worn by Yamamura the Wanderer. This Eastern
warrior pursued a beast for honourable revenge, then became a hunter of the League. But when
he stared straight into impurity, it drove him mad.

Old Hunter Arm Bands: Old Hunter arm bands wound tightly to prevent infection with the
scourge. Of course, the idea that the scourge was infectious was pure hearsay.

Wine Hakama: Garb of a distant Eastern land, worn by Yamamura the Wanderer. This Eastern
warrior pursued a beast for honourable revenge, then became a hunter of the League. But when
he stared straight into impurity, it drove him mad.

<keyItems>Key Items:
Cainhurst Badge: Badge of the royal guards of Cainhurst, loyal guardians of
the Vileblood Queen Annalise.

The Vilebloods are hunters of blood, and hunt prey as they
search for blood dregs. The hunter who joins them is faced
with a decision: to merely borrow their strength, or to
become one of them, heart and soul.

Cosmic Eye Watcher Badge: Badge of a member of the Choir, elites of the
Healing Church.

The eye signifies the very cosmos.

The Choir stumbled upon an epiphany, very suddenly and
quite by accident. Here we stand, feet planted in the earth,
but might the cosmos be very near us, only just above our
heads?

Crow Hunter Badge: Badge of a hunter of hunters, who hunts those who
have become intoxicated by their bloodlust.

The badge of the hunter of hunters is quitly
passed down from generation to generation,
usually to an outsider from the hinterlands.

To be entrusted with this cursed badge, one must
be strong, resilient to the seduction of blood,
and gracious when taking a comrade's life.

Old Hunter Badge: This hunter's badge, crafted in Gehrman's time, has no
practical purpose, except perhaps to assist in romanticising
about the past.

The badge was a special privilege for the hunters of the past,
and should not be dishonoured.

It should be left in peace, unless one is truly prepared to
assume the will of those gone before.

        
                                                                                    <page n="61"></page>


Powder Keg Hunter Badge: Badge crafted by the Powder Kegs, the heretics of the
Workshop.

The Powder Kegs aboration of complex design and big
booms culminated in weapon designs that contrast with
those traditionally of the Workshop.

The late Powder Kegs, bless their souls, had a motto:
"If a weapon ain't got kick, it just ain't worth it."

Radiant Sword Hunter Badge: One of the badges crafted by the Healing Church.

The radiant sword indicates the heirs to the will of Ludwig.

These hunters, also known as Holy Blades, are what remains
of an ancient line of heroes that date back to a very early
age of honour and chivalry.

Saw Hunter Badge: Badge crafted long ago at the Workshop. Attests to one's
prowess as a hunter of beasts.

The Workshop is gone, and no group recognises this
meaningless badge, except the messengers in the bath, who
understand its profundity.

Certain things can only be entrusted with a hunter in
possession of this badge, or so they believe.

Spark Hunter Badge: Badge crafted in secret by Archibald, the infamous eccentric
of the Healing Church, for his friends.

Archibald was fascinated by the blue sparks that emanate
from the hides of the darkbeasts, and dedicated his life to its
artificial reproduction, in a style of inquiry that, incidentally,
closely followed the methodology of Byrgenwerth.

Sword Hunter Badge: One of the badges crafted by the Healing Church.
The silver sword is a symbol of a Church hunter.

Ludwig was the first of many Healing Church hunters to


         
                                                                                   <page n="62"></page>


come, many of whom were clerics. As it was, clerics
transformed into the most hideous beasts.

Wheel Hunter Badge: Martyr Logarius led a band of Executioners, and this badge
was crafted at their dedicated workshop. The wheel
symbolizes righteous destiny.

Their workshop was a secretive enclave of mystical beliefs
and heady fanaticism which served as the backbone of the
Executioners' unique brand of justice.

Firing Hammer Badge: Badge crafted by the Oto Workshop, precursor to the
workshop of the heretical Powder Kegs.

The Powder Kegs were driven by singular ideas, and crafted
strange weapons of great intricacy.
It is clear that the philosophy of the Powder Kegs was
already established at this time.

Cainhurst Summons: An old blood-stained summons, inviting an honored guest
to the forsaken Castle Cainhurst.

Rather bafflingly, it is addressed to you.

Do not hesitate; the stagecoach leaves from Hemwick crossing.

Hunter Chief Emblem: A cloth emblem that belonged to the captain of the Church
hunters long ago. Opens the main gate that leads to the
round plaza of the Great Cathedral.

The main gate is shut tight on nights of the hunt, and could
only be opened from the other side with this emblem. In
other words, the captain's return, and this
emblem, determined the end of the hunt.

Iron Door Key: Of the three great bridges that link the two cathedral
cradles, this key opens the iron door that leads to the
midlevel bridge.

There are no thieves in the nightmare. Then, why lock a


        
                                                                                    <page n="63"></page>


door? Be warned, there must be a very, very good reason.

Lecture Theatre Key: Key to the Lecture Theatre in the Lecture Building.

Today, the two-story Lecture Building is adrift in the
nightmare, but once it was a place of reflection, where
scholars learned of history and archaeology.

Perhaps it still is, as the students in the lecture theatre
appear to await the return of their professor.

Lunarium Key: Key to the lunarium facing the lake on the second floor of
Byrgenwerth College.

In his final years, Master Willem was fond of the lookout,
and the rocking chair that he kept there for meditation.
In the end, it is said, he left his secret with the lake.

Oedon Tomb Key: Key to the gate that blocks the Tomb of Oedon.

Beyond the tomb, Oedon Chapel can be found in the center
of the Cathedral Ward.

Only today the church is abandoned, and some say that the
residents of Oedon have all gone mad.

Old Hunter Bell: One of the resonating bells that cross the gaps of worlds.
This bell is cracked and stained with the blood of beasts.

A human must expend Insight to ring this uncanny bell.

The old hunters, who have long passed from the dream but
cannot forget the feeling of the hunt, rely upon messengers
to relay their thoughts.
Ring the bell at their side, and they are certain to give a listen.
For the night of the hunt is long, and unchanging.




         
                                                                                           <page n="64"></page>


Orphanage Key: Key to the Orphanage, birthplace of the Choir.

The Orphanage, shadowed by the Grand Cathedral, was a
place of scholarship and experimentation, where young
orphans became potent unseen thinkers for the Healing
Church.

The Choir, that would later split from the Healing Church,
was a creation of the Orphanage.

Queenly Flesh: What remains of Annalise, blood queen of Cainhurst.

This pinkish lump of flesh remains warm, as if cursed.
All hail the undying queen of blood!

Ring of Betrothal: The inhuman beings known as the Great Ones imbued this
ring of betrothal with some special meaning.

In the age of the Great Ones, wedlock was a blood contract,
only permitted to those slated to bear a special child.

Short Ritual Root Chalice: One of the root chalices that breaks various seals in the Old
Labyrinth.

The glass chalice, when full, is used in a short ritual to
quickly create and join a Chalice Dungeon (not for use in a
ritual using standard materials).

Short rituals are conducted at the makeshift altar.

Small Hair Ornament: A small, very ordinary hair ornament.

Although it has been lost for quite some time, one can still
see signs of the care with which this tasteful ornament was
once kept.

Its colour would stand out most brilliantly against a head of
greyish hair.

Tonsil Stone: A latticed, deformed rock, or perhaps a meteorite.

Appears useless, but possesses some old gravitational force
that prevents its riddance. A dubious soul once said:

"Step lightly round to the right of the great cathedral, and
seek an ancient, shrouded church... The gift of the godhead
will grant you strength..."

Unopened Summons: An old, sealed summons.

Like the first of its kind, it is an invitation to Cainhurst, but
for whom is not known, as it lacks addressee.

Upper Cathedral Key: The key to the Upper Cathedral Ward seal.

The upper echelons of the Healing Church are formed by the
School of Mensis, based in the Unseen Village, and the Choir
occupying the Upper Cathedral Ward.

This key brings one a step closer to the Choir.

Yharnam Stone: A sacred heirloom left by Yharnam, Pthumerian Queen.

The Queen lies dead, but her horrific consciousness
is only asleep, and stirs in unsettling motions.

Astral Clocktower Key: Key to the Astral Clocktower at the top of the Grand
Cathedral.

The caretaker of the tower's numerous patients, known to
them only as Lady Maria, made her home behind the giant
star-interpreting clock.

Balcony Key: Key to the balcony on the first floor of the Research Hall.

Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower gave this to the patient,
Adeline.

Maria had hoped Adeline would find comfort in the faint


         
                                                                                    <page n="66"></page>


breeze that carried the scent of flowers from the outside, but
Adeline couldn't fathom her intentions.

First Brain Fluid: Greyish amoeba-shaped brain fluid. Wobbles and bounces.

Extracted from a patient whose head expanded until that
was all that they were.

In the early days of the Healing Church, the Great Ones were
linked to the ocean, and so the cerebral patients would imbibe
water, and listen for the howl of the sea. Brain fluid writhed
inside the head, the initial makings of internal eyes.

Second Brain Fluid: Greyish amoeba-shaped brain fluid. Wobbles and bounces.

Extracted from a patient whose head expanded until that
was all that they were.

Once, a young girl had an older brother who was determined to
become a doctor, and so she wilfully became his patient. In the
end, this led to their encounter with the Eldritch Truth,
for which they considered themselves blessed.

Adeline’s Brain Fluid: Greyish amoeba-shaped brain fluid. Wobbles and bounces.

Extracted from a patient whose head expanded until that
was all that they were.

We fail to realize our own latent potential, until the
moment it is lost, and we sense its absence. Ironically,
this is the very nature of insight, like the moment one
licks one's own blood, only to be startled by its sweetness.

Celestial Dial: A celestial dial that functions with the giant Astral Clock in
the Grand Cathedral.

When the dial is held up towards the Astral Clock, the clock
will come to life, and reveal a secret to its curious interloper.




         
                                                                                      <page n="67"></page>


Eye of a blood-drunk Hunter: The eye of a blood-drunk hunter. Its pupil is collapsed and
turned to mush, indicating the onset of the scourge of beasts.

A hunter who goes drunk with blood is said to be taken by
the Nightmare, destined to wander forever, engaged in an
endless hunt. It is a fate that no hunter can escape.

Eye Pendant: An eye pendant which unlocks the surgery altar.

There are two cathedrals in the Hunter's Dream. One lies
past the River of Blood, and another contains the private
research hall of the Healing Church.

Only chosen members of the Healing Church, or their
lamentable patients, can enter the research hall, using this
eye.

Grant eyes to the surgery altar skull.

Laurence’s Skull: Skull of Laurence, first vicar of the Healing Church.
In reality he became the first cleric beast, and his human
skull only exists within the Nightmare.

The skull is a symbol of Laurence's past, and what he failed
to protect. He is destined to seek his skull, but even if he
found it, it could never restore his memories.

Underground Cell Inner Chamber Key: Key to the inner chamber of the cell below the Grand
Cathedral.

The innermost chamber of the underground cell holds a lone
madman. He wears a beast hide, and rings a bell that emits
no sound.

Unending death awaits those who can hear the soundless
bell.

Underground Cell Key: Key to the cell below the Grand Cathedral.

Hunters are held within the underground cell, so that things


        
                                                                                   <page n="68"></page>


better left unseen, and knowledge better left unknown, will
decay quietly in the fallow darkness.

Blood Gem Workshop Tool: A misplaced workshop tool from the Hunter's Dream.

The hunter who retrieves this can fortify weapons by
kneading blood gems into them.

Blood gems add properties to weapons when used to
fortify them, as blood defines an organism.

Rune Workshop Tool: Runesmith Caryll, student of Byrgenwerth, transcribed the
inhuman utterings of the Great Ones into what are now
called Caryll Runes.

The hunter who retrieves this workshop tool can etch Caryll
Runes into the mind to attain their wondrous strength.

Provost Willem would have been proud of Caryll's runes, as
they do not rely upon blood in any measure.

Workshop Haze Extractor: A misplace workshop tool from the Hunter's Dream.

The hunter who retrieves this can extract Arcane Haze
from ritual materials.

But alas, spent materials are lost.

Black Messenger Hat: Hat that messengers are oddly fond of.
Symbol of the preventative hunters of
the Healing Church.

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an
interest in adornment. Why not let them be happy,
and revel as babes?

Blood Messenger Head Bandage: Accessory adored by naive messengers imitating
the bandages of scourge victims, unaware of their meaning.
The spatters of blood give it a particularly
nice touch.


        
                                                                                   <page n="69"></page>

A nice top hat rounds out any Yharnam gentleman.

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an interest in
adornment. Why not let them be happy, and revel as babes?

Messenger Urn Festival: Accessory adored by naїve messengers.

The messengers wear the urns, filled with incense that wards
off beasts, on their heads upside-down, suggesting a
predilection to the dark.

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an interest in
adornment. Why not let them be happy, and revel as babes?

Red Messenger Ribbon: Red ribbon that messengers are oddly fond of.

The thick, pungent red was drawn from the organs
of some unfortunate victim.

A strange choice indeed, but perhaps for the messengers
wearing this accessory constitutes a form of mourning.

White Messenger Ribbon: White ribbon that messengers are oddly fond of.

A ribbon made of fine lace that shines remarkably,
more suited to pretty young girls than silly old
messengers.



        
                                                                                     <page n="70"></page>

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an interest in
adornment. Why not let them be happy, and revel as babes?

Yharnam Messenger Hat: Hat that messengers are oddly fond of.

Commonly called a Yharnam hat.

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an interest
in adornment. Why not let them be happy, and revel as
babes?

<consumables>Consumables:
Antidote: Small medicinal tablets that counteract poison.

Used to treat ashen blood, the baffling sickness that ravaged
Old Yharnam long ago.

These tablets only provide short-term relief. The ashen blood
ailment eventually triggered the spread of the beastly
scourge.

Beast Blood Pellet: Large medicinal pellets, supposedly formed of coagulated
beast blood. Banned by the Healing Church due to
their unclear origin. Grants a spurt of beasthood.

Ripping apart the flesh of one's enemies and being
rained upon by their splattering blood invigorates
one's sense of beasthood, feeding strength and
euphoric feeling alike.

Blood of Adella: Blood taken from Adella, nun of the Healing Church.
Restores an amount of HP, then continues to gradually
restore HP for a short time.

The Healing Church nuns are chosen for their merit as
vessels for blood, and groomed as Blood Saints.


        
                                                                                   <page n="71"></page>


The mere chance of being treated with their blood lends
legitimacy to the Healing Church and communion.

Blood of Arianna: Blood taken from Arianna, Cathedral Ward woman of
pleasure. The sweet blood of Arianna restores HP, and
temporarily speeds stamina recovery.

A member of the old Healing Church would know that her
blood is similar to precisely what was once forbidden.

Blood Vial: Special blood used in ministration. Restores HP.

Once a patient has had their blood ministered, a unique but
common treatment in Yharnam, successive infusions recall
the first, and are all the more invigorating for it.

No surprise that most Yharnamites are heavy users of blood.

Great One’s Wisdom: Fragments of the lost wisdom of the Great Ones, beings that
might be described as gods.

Use to gain Insight.

At Byrgenwerth, Master Willem had an epiphany:
"We are thinking on the basest of planes. What we need, are
more eyes."

Iosefka’s Blood Vial: Blood vial acquired from Iosefka's clinic.

This refined blood, highly invigorating,
restores a larger amount of HP.

The product of a slow and careful refinement process,
this rare blood vial appears to be a clinic original.

Madman’s Knowledge: Skull of a madman touched by the wisdom of
the Great Ones.

Use to gain Insight.
Making contact with eldritch wisdom is a blessing,


        
                                                                                         <page n="72"></page>


for even if it drives one mad,
it allows one to serve a grander purpose, for posterity.

Sedatives: Liquid medicine concocted at Byrgenwerth.
Calms the nerves.

Those who delve into the arcane fall all-too-easily
to madness, and thick human blood serves to calm
the frayed nerves of these inquisitive minds. Naturally,
this often leads to a reliance on blood ministration.

Workshop Third Umbilical Cord: A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every
infant Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.

Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate. The Third Umbilical Cord
precipitated the encounter with the pale moon, which beckoned the hunters and conceived the
hunter's dream.

Use to gain Insight and, so they say, eyes on the inside, although no one remembers what that
truly entails.

Arianna’s Third Umbilical Cord: A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every
infant Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.

Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate, and Oedon, the formless Great
One, is no different. To think, it was corrupted blood that began this eldritch liaison.

Use to gain Insight and, so they say, eyes on the inside, although no one remembers what that
truly entails.

“Iosefka’s” Third Umbilical Cord: A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every
infant Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.

Provost Willem sought the Cord in order to elevate his being and thoughts to those of a Great
One, by lining his brain with eyes. The only choice, he knew, if man were to ever match Their
greatness.




        
                                                                                        <page n="73"></page>


Mergo’s Third Umbilical Cord: A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every infant
Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.

Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate. This Cord granted Mensis
audience with Mergo, but resulted in the stillbirth of their brains.

Use to gain Insight and, so they say, eyes on the inside, although no one remembers what that
truly entails.

Blood of Adeline: Blood taken from Adeline, patient of the research hall.
Restores HP, and continues to rejuvenate HP for some time.

Adeline was originally one of the Blood Saints who received
treatment by the Church to cultivate worthy blood. Adeline's
was one of the few cases that turned out favorably.

Lead Elixir: A heavy, syrupy liquid medicine.
Temporarily shifts weight to make deflection of attacks
easier, but must be used with care, as it also slows
movement with no change to defense.

Its recipe for this mysterious concoction is unknown, but
some postulate that it materializes only within the most
desperate nightmares.

Blue Elixir: Dubious liquid medicine used in strange experiments
conducted by high ministers of the Healing Church.

A type of anesthetic that numbs the brain.

Hunters, able to retain consciousness by force of will, make
use of a secondary effect of the medicine, which dilutes their
presence while standing still.

Bold Hunter’s Mark: Dubious liquid medicine used in strange experiments
conducted by high ministers of the Healing Church.

A type of anesthetic that numbs the brain.

Hunters, able to retain consciousness by force of will, make

use of a secondary effect of the medicine, which dilutes their
presence while standing still.

Hunter’s Mark: Dangling, upside-down rune etched in one's mind.
Symbol of a hunter.

By focusing one's thoughts on this rune, a hunter
loses all Blood Echoes, but awakens afresh,
as if it were all just a bad dream.
</consumables>

<weaponBuffs>Weapon Buffs:
Bolt Paper: Coarse paper that applies bolt to weapons when rubbed.

Invented by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing
Church workshop. Artificially recreates the blue sparks that
are said to surround darkbeasts.

Unlike the other strange weapons created by Archibald, this
one was favored by many hunters, in particular those who
had even once laid eyes on a darkbeast.

Bone Marrow Ash: Additional medium that strengthens Quicksilver Bullets.

According to the workshop, this is a special bone marrow
ash collected from Hemwick Charnel Lane.

Invaluable to hunters with weak bloodtinge who require the use of stronger firearms.

Fire Paper: Coarse paper that applies fire to weapons when rubbed.

A hunter tool found in the Healing Church workshop.

Since the tragedy that struck Old Yharnam, fire has become
a staple in beast hunts, and is thought to cleanse impurity.

Certain types of beasts have an abnormal fear of flame.

<throwableItems>Throwable Items:
Molotov Cocktail: Explodes in raging flames when thrown against an object.
One of the oldest hunter tools available in the workshop.

Since the tragedy that struck Old Yharnam, fire has become
a staple in beast hunts, and is thought to cleanse impurity.

Certain types of beasts have an abnormal fear of flame.

Oil Urn: When this urn hits its mark, the target is drenched in oil, and
made extremely flammable.

Fire is commonplace on the hunt, and oil urns accentuate its
effect. Sometimes, when hunters burn beasts, they appear
intoxicated by the euphoria of purification.

Pebbles: Small Pebbles found throughout Yharnam.

Can be thrown at foes.

Quite thrilling.

Poison Knife: A knife slathered in poison.

This curved knife is as thin and sharp as a surgeon's blade.
Often used for self-defence by special doctors in the Healing
Church.

They say that hunters traditionally avoid the use of poison,
likely because the poison is too slow to act in the heat of the hunt.

Quicksilver Bullets: Special bullets used with hunter firearms.

Ordinary bullets have no effect on beasts,
and so Quicksilver Bullets, fused with the wielder's
own blood, must be employed.

The strength of Quicksilver Bullets depends greatly
upon wielder's bloodtinge.

         
                                                                                   <page n="76"></page>


Rope Molotov Cocktail: Exploding molotov cocktail that is thrown behind.

Allows for more maneuvering compared to an ordinary
Molotov cocktail, and can catch foes off guard.

Since the tragedy that struck Old Yharnam, fire has become
a staple in beast hunts, and is thought to cleanse impurity.

Certain types of beasts have an abnormal fear of flame.

Shaman Bone Blade: A blade of bone coated with gruesome spinal fluid.
Used by old labyrinth watchers, in particular, those presiding
over rituals.

When victim is cut by this blade, the green spinal fluid
temporarily numbs the senses, disturbing the target's gross
motor skills. The blade, never intended for battle, must cut
deep to be effective, and breaks.

Throwing Knife: Throwing knife with a finely serrated blade.

One of the old hunter Henryk's favorite weapons.

Does not cause a great deal of damage to beasts, but with
deft use, can distract attackers and keep them at bay.

Delayed Molotov: A special hunter tool crafted by the old Oto Workshop.
These molotovs wedge into the ground when thrown, and
explode on a timed delay.

A shame that such a complex gadget must be sacrificed with
each use of this inefficient hunter tool. Nevertheless, delayed
molotovs are cherished by the minority of hunters who
prefer the tricksier kill. This creation is one of the earliest-
known roots of the Powder Kegs.

Pungent Blood Cocktail: Mature blood cocktail that releases a pungent odor when
thrown that attracts blood-thirsty beasts.

A precious tool in sadly short supply.

In Yharnam, they produce more blood than alcohol, as the
former is the more intoxicating.

Numbing Mist: Throw to create a mist cloud that numbs a hunter's life
essence and prevents restoration of HP.

Said to be used by the blood hunters of Cainhurst, its recipe
is a secret closely guarded by the line of nobles inhabiting
the castle.

</throwableItems>

<misc>Misc:
Blood Dreg: The Vilebloods of Cainhurst, blood-lusting hunters,
see these frightful things in coldblood.

They often appear in the blood of echo fiends, that is to say,
the blood of hunters. Queen Annalise partakes in these blood
dregs offerings, so that she may one day bear the Child of
Blood, the next Vileblood heir.

Gold Pendant: Pendant of Vicar Amelia. Use to change into a Blood Gem,
which fortifies weapons.

This pendant, passed down among the vicars who head the Healing Church,
is a reminder of the cautionary adage. To reveal the adage,
touch the altar skull.

Hand Lantern: Small portable lantern.

This hunting accessory provides light while leaving
both hands free to hold weapons. The torch, however, provides a stronger source of light.

Monocular: Monocular used to View things up close.

Not a hunter's tool, but a simple antique, to be used as one sees fit.

Red Jeweled Brooch: A woman's bright-red brooch, engraved with the name Viola.

Perhaps the jewel is a gift from a hunter. Use to change into
a droplet blood gem that fortifies any weapon.

With the proper workshop tool, various weapons can be
fortified.

Shining Coins: Various coins that are particularly luminous.

There are very few uses for spare change during the hunt,
but these will serve as guides through the darkness.

Or, one could save them until morning, if it ever comes.

Tear Stone: Silver-shining tear stone.

Use to change into a droplet blood gem that fortifies any
weapon.

A doll sheds neither blood nor tears, and thus its nature
remains unknown.

Tiny Music Box: A small music box received from a young Yharnam girl.
Plays a song shared by her mother and father.

Inside the lid is a small scrap of paper, perhaps an old
message. Two names can be made out, however faintly.

Viola and Gascoigne.

Vermin: A centipede-like creature discovered on successful hunts by
League hunters.

Vermin, found hidden within filth, are only seen by League
confederates, and are the root of man's impurity. The League
has assumed the task of finding and crushing all vermin.

Perhaps there is some mercy in the madness. Those who
wish to see vermin can, and those who choose to are
provided with boundless purpose.


Coldblood:
Coldblood Dew: Droplet of coldblood containing Blood Echoes.

Use to gain Blood Echoes.

Hunters sustained by the dream gain strength from Blood
Echoes. They imbibe the blood with thoughts of reverence,
indeed gratitude, for their victims.

Thick Coldblood: A thick droplet of coldblood containing Blood Echoes.

Use to gain a larger amount of Blood Echoes.

A strong will produces thick blood. Doubtless, the product of
obsession, a potent source of human strength.

Frenzied Coldblood: A rich droplet of coldblood containing Blood Echoes.

Use to gain frenzied Blood Echoes.

This manifestation of madness comes from a mind teetering
on the very brink, but has a sane mind ever produced
anything of true significance?

Kin Coldblood: Coldblood of inhuman kin of the cosmos, brethren of the
Great Ones.

Use to gain unspeakable Blood Echoes.

        
                                                                                      <page n="80"></page>


Dare not to delve into the world beyond humanity, the

<arcaneBloodtingeTools>Arcane/Bloodtinge Tools:
A Call Beyond: One of the secrets of the Choir.

Long ago, the Healing Church used phantasms to reach a
lofty plane of darkness, but failed to make contact with the
outer reaches of the cosmos.

The rite failed to achieve its intended purpose, but instead
created a small exploding star, now a powerful part of the
Choir's arsenal.
At times, failure is the mother of invention.

Augur of Ebrietas: One of the secret rites of the Choir,
high-ranking members of the Healing Church.

           
                                                                                    <page n="81"></page>



Use spirits, the invertebrates known to be augurs of
the Great Ones, to partially summon abandoned Ebrietas.

One of the few rites that allow one to directly utilize
the power of the Great Ones, and evidence that
the Choir had approached the eldritch Truth.

Beast Roar: One of the forbidden hunter tools
made by Irreverent Izzy.

Borrow the strength of the terrible undead darkbeasts,
if only for a moment, to blast surrounding foes back with
the force of a roaring beast.

The indescribable sound is broadcast with the caster's
own vocal cords, which begs the question, what terrible
things lurk deep within the frames of men?

Empty Phantasm Shell: Empty invertebrate shell that is said to be a familiar of a
Great One. The Healing Church has discovered a great
variety of invertebrates, or phantasms, as they are called.

Shells with slime still harbour arcane power, and can be
rubbed on weapons to imbue them with their strength.

Executioner's Gloves: One of the secret treasures hidden in Cainhurst.
The gloves of an executioner from a faraway land.

Passed from executioner father to executioner son,
these gloves can be used to summon wrathful spirits
of the past by smearing them with blood.

It is said that the nobles found in immeasurable delight
in the dances of these vengeful specters.

Choir Bell: Special hunter tool of the Choir, high-ranking
member of the church. Fashioned after a bell that
projects an arcane sound across planes of existence.



        
                                                                                   <page n="82"></page>


The sound of this smaller, silver version of the bell
does not cross planes, but grants vigor and healing
to all cooperators.

Messenger’s Gift: A strange gift from the messengers, inhabitants of
the dream who revere the brave hunters.

Use to envelop oneself in a black nightmarish mist,
then transform into a messenger. The illusion is a parlor
trick, and any large movement will break the spell.

To preserve the guise, proceed very slowly.

Old Hunter Bone:
The bone of an old hunter whose name is lost.

It is said that he was an apprentice to old Gehrman, and a
practitioner of the art of Quickening, a technique particular
to the first hunters.

It is most appropriate that hunters, carriers of the torch who
are sustained by the dream, would tease an old art from his
remains.

Tiny Tonitrus: Tonitrus is a unique weapon crafted by Archibald,
the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop.

This is a similar morning star mace that utilizes
Quicksilver Bullets. When struck into the ground,
it recreates the blue sparks that are said to surround
the darkbeasts.

Like Archibald's masterpiece, this too
is a superb conductor of the powerful blue sparks.

Accursed Brew: Skull of a local from the violated fishing village. The inside
of the skull was forcibly searched for eyes, as evidenced by

<caryllRunes>Caryll Runes:
Beast Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

A transcription of the roar of a labyrinth beast, the bearer of
the "Beast" rune has accentuated transformation effects.

"Beast" is one of the early Caryll Runes, as well as one of the
first to be deemed forbidden. The discovery of blood entailed
the discovery of undesirable beasts.

Blood Rapture Rune: A Caryll rune that transcribes inhuman sounds.
"Blood Rapture" is the raw euphoria of the warmth of blood.
Restores HP with visceral attacks, one of the darker hunter
techniques.

This rune resonates with servants of the Queen, carrier of
the Child of Blood, who yearn for their Queen's blood with
little hope of requitement.

For them, they find solace in "Blood Rapture," that serves as
a surrogate for their desires.

Clawmark Rune: A Caryll rune that transcribes inhuman sounds.

The "Clawmark" is an impulse to seek the warmth of blood
like a beast. It strengthens visceral attacks, one of the darker
hunter techniques.

Although the difference is subtle, Runesmith Caryll describes
the "Beast" as a horrific and unwelcome instinct deep within
the hearts of men, while "Clawmark" is an alluring invitation
to accept this very nature.

Communion Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

Several runes relate to "blood," including "Communion,"
which raises the maximum number of blood vials
one may carry.


        
                                                                                   <page n="89"></page>

ministers. Blood ministration is, of course, the pursuit
of communion.

Ones. Allows one to make additional discoveries.

guidance, and sought to line his brain with eyes in order to
elevate his thoughts.

Formless Oedon Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

The Great One Oedon, lacking form, exists only in voice,
and is symbolised by this rune. Those who memorise it enjoy
a larger supply of Quicksilver Bullets.

Human or no, the oozing blood is a medium of the highest
grade, and the essence of the formless Great One, Oedon.
Both Oedon, and his inadvertent worshippers, surreptitiously
seek the precious blood.

Heir Rune: A Caryll rune that transcribes inhuman sounds.

The "Heir" sees sentimentality in the warmth of blood, and
acknowledges visceral attacks as one of the darker hunter
techniques.

More blood echoes gained from visceral attacks.

those before him.

Moon Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

                                                                                   <page n="90"></page>

grade, and the essence of the formless Great One, Oedon.
Both Oedon, and Oedon's inadvertent worshippers,

Guidance Rune: A Caryll rune discovered by the old hunter Ludwig along
with the Holy Moonlight Sword.
Boosts amount of life recovered by rallying.

nothingness, and that is where he discovered the tiny beings
of light. Ludwig was certain that these playful dancing
sprites offered "guidance," and emptied Ludwig of his fears
at least in the midst of a hunt.

Lake Runes: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices
ripples like a watery reflection. This rune means "Lake,"
and those branded by it enjoy augmented defense.

Corruption Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

Several runes contain a nuance of "Blood," including the
rune of "Corruption," associated with the oath of the corrupt.

Pledgers to this oath are Cainhurst Vilebloods, hunters of
blood who find dregs for their Queen in coldblood,
particularly in that of hunters.


        
                                                                                   <page n="92"></page>

thus subject to the wrath of the Executioners.

adopted by those who have taken the Hunter of Hunters oath.

with blood. Be they men or beasts, anyone who has
threatened the pledgers of the "Hunter" oath surely has an
issue with blood.

other worlds, and hunt to discover vermin.

impurity. Crush all vermin without hesitation.

Radiance Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

The rune for "Radiance," adopted by the sworn
Executioners under Logarius' command.

The executioners despise the impure Vilebloods,
and no matter what the circumstances, would
never cooperate with the bloodthirsty hunters
who serve the undead queen, Annalise.

Beast’s Embrace Rune: After repeated experiments in controlling the scourge of
beasts, the gentle "Embrace" rune was discovered.

When its implementation failed, the "Embrace" became a
forbidden rune, but its knowledge became a foundation of
the Healing Church.

Those who swear this oath take on a ghastly form, and enjoy
accentuated transformation effects, especially while wielding a beast weapon.


        
                                                                                   <page n="93"></page>


Milkweed Rune: A Caryll rune envisioned by Adeline, patient of the
research hall.

A transcription of the inhuman, sticky whispers that reveal
the nature of a celestial attendant.
