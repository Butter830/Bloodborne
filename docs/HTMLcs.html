               Use spirits, the invertebrates known to be augurs of
               the Great Ones, to partially summon abandoned Ebrietas.
               
               One of the few rites that allow one to directly utilize
               the power of the Great Ones, and evidence that
               the Choir had approached the eldritch Truth.</td>

               Small portable lantern.
               This hunting accessory provides light while leaving
               both hands free to hold weapons. The torch, however, provides a stronger source of
               light.

               There are very few uses for spare change during the hunt,
               but these will serve as guides through the darkness.
               
               Or, one could save them until morning, if it ever comes.
