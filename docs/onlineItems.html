               Its ring resonates across worlds, and the first hunter used it
               as a special signal to call hunters from other worlds to cross
               the gap and cooperate.
               
               
               A human must use Insight to ring this uncanny bell, but the
               benefits of cross-world cooperation are many.

               to uphold the illusion.
