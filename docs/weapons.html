               Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen
               wield them like clubs. 
               Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand

               weight, staggering kick, and lavish use of Quicksilver Bullets, into battle. Such
               a monstrosity was doomed from the start, and indeed its development was cut short.

               An oversized weapon used by the Healing Church. A type of cannon that fires with a

               ordinary hunter.
               But the men lacked the wits to effectively operate firearms, and the weapon was quietly
               ushered into permanent storage."
