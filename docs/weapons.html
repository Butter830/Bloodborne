               The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
               Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen
               wield them like clubs. 
               Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand
               quivers as if it were still alive.

               Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
               Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the
               weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of
               beastly power. 
               As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the
               wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."

               This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed
               the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy
               whip. 
               This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that
               the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black
               and reds."

               A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the
               saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted,
               allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
               Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws
               and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."

               Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite,

               the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
               This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated

               A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits
               a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
               Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored
               by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."

               A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its
               blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
               Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might
               rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "

               When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with
               blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues.

               The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions

               When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its
               great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
               The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever
               set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be
               of a very private, elusive sort."

               One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used on the hunt. Retains the qualities
               of an axe, but offers a wider palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy blunt
               attack, leading to high rally potential. No matter their pasts, beasts are no more
               than beasts. Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner."

               handled silver sword. On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized by
               a blunt strike and extreme force of impact. The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless
               stance toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most

               A trick sword originated in the same country as the Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword
               feeds not off blood, but instead demands great dexterity. 
               Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she frowned upon blood blades,
               despite being a distant relative of the queen. 
               One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into a dark well, when she could

               The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers to the sanguine plague,

               weapon. Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only trick weapon with

               his liking. The large curved blade serves as a bow when transformed.

               the flesh of foes. 
               The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but is difficult to use

               Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as a whip when its blade
               is split into many. Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the beasts
