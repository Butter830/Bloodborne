               When its implementation failed, the "Embrace" became a
               forbidden rune, but its knowledge became a foundation of
               the Healing Church.

               the "Beast" rune has accentuated transformation effects.
               
               "Beast" is one of the early Caryll Runes, as well as one of the
               first to be deemed forbidden. The discovery of blood entailed
               the discovery of undesirable beasts.</td>

               techniques.
               
               This rune resonates with servants of the Queen, carrier of
               the Child of Blood, who yearn for their Queen's blood with
               little hope of requitement.
               
               For them, they find solace in "Blood Rapture," that serves as
               a surrogate for their desires. </td>

               The "Clawmark" is an impulse to seek the warmth of blood
               like a beast. It strengthens visceral attacks, one of the darker
               hunter techniques.
               
               Although the difference is subtle, Runesmith Caryll describes
               the "Beast" as a horrific and unwelcome instinct deep within
               the hearts of men, while "Clawmark" is an alluring invitation

               Several runes relate to "blood," including "Communion,"

               This rune represents the Healing Church and its

               Several runes contain a nuance of "Blood," including the
               rune of "Corruption," associated with the oath of the corrupt.
               
               Pledgers to this oath are Cainhurst Vilebloods, hunters of
               blood who find dregs for their Queen in coldblood,
               particularly in that of hunters.

               Ones. Allows one to make additional discoveries.
               
               Eyes symbolize the truth Master Willem sought in his
               research. Disillusioned by the limits of human intellect,
               Master Willem looked to beings from higher planes for

               a larger supply of Quicksilver Bullets.
               
               Human or no, the oozing blood is a medium of the highest

               When Ludwig closed his eyes, he saw darkness, or perhaps
               nothingness, and that is where he discovered the tiny beings
               of light. Ludwig was certain that these playful dancing
               sprites offered "guidance," and emptied Ludwig of his fears

               techniques.
               
               More blood echoes gained from visceral attacks.
               
               Perhaps the "Heir" is a hunter who bears the echoing will of

               These watchmen admonish those who have become addled
               with blood. Be they men or beasts, anyone who has

               Confederates of The League cooperate with hunters from
               other worlds, and hunt to discover vermin.
