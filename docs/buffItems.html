               Invented by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing
               Church workshop. Artificially recreates the blue sparks that
               are said to surround darkbeasts.
               
               Unlike the other strange weapons created by Archibald, this
               one was favored by many hunters, in particular those who
               had even once laid eyes on a darkbeast.</td>

               According to the workshop, this is a special bone marrow
               ash collected from Hemwick Charnel Lane.
               
               Invaluable to hunters with weak bloodtinge who require the use of stronger firearms.</td>

               A hunter tool found in the Healing Church workshop.
               
               Since the tragedy that struck Old Yharnam, fire has become
               a staple in beast hunts, and is thought to cleanse impurity.
               
               Certain types of beasts have an abnormal fear of flame.</td>
