               Long ago, the Healing Church used phantasms to reach a
               lofty plane of darkness, but failed to make contact with the
               outer reaches of the cosmos.
               
               The rite failed to achieve its intended purpose, but instead
               created a small exploding star, now a powerful part of the
               Choir's arsenal.
               At times, failure is the mother of invention.</td>

               No wonder the skull became stewed in curses.

               The indescribable sound is broadcast with the caster's
               own vocal cords, which begs the question, what terrible

               these gloves can be used to summon wrathful spirits
               of the past by smearing them with blood.

               to the first hunters.
               
               It is most appropriate that hunters, carriers of the torch who

               Quicksilver Bullets. When struck into the ground,
               it recreates the blue sparks that are said to surround
               the darkbeasts.
