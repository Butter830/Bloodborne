               Long ago, the Healing Church used phantasms to reach a
               lofty plane of darkness, but failed to make contact with the
               outer reaches of the cosmos.
               
               The rite failed to achieve its intended purpose, but instead
               created a small exploding star, now a powerful part of the
               Choir's arsenal.
               At times, failure is the mother of invention.</td>

               No wonder the skull became stewed in curses.

               the force of a roaring beast.
               
               The indescribable sound is broadcast with the caster's
               own vocal cords, which begs the question, what terrible

               Deep within the eye lies a vast stretch of dark
               sky that rumbles with an endless meteor storm.

               these gloves can be used to summon wrathful spirits
               of the past by smearing them with blood.

               The poisonous snake grew uncontrollably, raised on a
               healthy diet of beast entrails. Even after their deaths, it is

               practitioner of the art of Quickening, a technique particular
               to the first hunters.
               
               It is most appropriate that hunters, carriers of the torch who
               are sustained by the dream, would tease an old art from his

               This is a similar morning star mace that utilizes
               Quicksilver Bullets. When struck into the ground,
               it recreates the blue sparks that are said to surround
               the darkbeasts.
               
               Like Archibald's masterpiece, this too
               is a superb conductor of the powerful blue sparks.</td>
