                                               Dialogue

Blood Minister: Good. All signed and sealed. Now, let's begin the transfusion. Oh, don't you
worry. Whatever happens... You may think it all a mere bad dream...

Now, let’s begin the transfusion.

Iosefka: Are you... out on the hunt? Then I'm very sorry, but... I cannot open this door. I am
Iosefka. The patients here in my clinic must not be exposed to infection. I know that you hunt for
us, for our town, but I'm sorry. Please. This is all that I can do.

Now, go. And good hunting.

Are you still in need of something? But I have nothing more to offer. Please, try to understand
my position. I can only pray, for a fruitful hunt.

You are safe, thank goodness. But I'm afraid nothing will change. I cannot open the door. I'll do
what I can, of course. Perhaps this will help you, if only in some small way.

Now, go. I pray for your safety.

You are safe, thank goodness. But I'm afraid nothing will change. I cannot open the door. I'll do
what I can, of course. Perhaps this will help you, if only in some small way.

This night is long, but morning always comes. Someone of your caliber won't fail us, I am
certain. And once the night of the hunt ends, we can speak face-to-face. Then I can finally see
what you look like. I shouldn't be thinking this but I am rather looking forward to it. So please,
be careful out there.

I'm sorry...I have nothing else to offer you. I will pray for your safety. May light shine upon this
night, and your fortunes.

Ah oh.

Please stop! It's beasts you hunt. Why are you behaving like one? This can't be the real you.
Please, stop....

Are you calm again? Thank goodness. You mustn't let the hunt overcome you. Remember
yourself. You are not a beast.

You are no more than a beast. I should've known....

Eileen the Crow: Oh, a hunter, are ya? And an outsider? What a mess you've been caught up in.
And tonight, of all nights. Here, to welcome the new hunter.

Prepare yourself for the worst. There are no humans left. They're all flesh-hungry beasts, now.

Still lingering about? What's wrong? A hunter, unnerved by a few beasts? Heh heh...
No matter, without fear in our hearts, we're little different from the beasts themselves.

What are you still doing here? Enough trembling in your boots. A hunter must hunt.

Look at you, you sorry drunk. I'll string you up like the filthy beast you are. You shall not
abscond your crimes.

Were you not once a hunter? Is this sincerely what you want? That’s enough now... No one will
blame you.

The beasts cannot be stopped!

What good are hunters now?

Your blood is mine!

A hunter's blood for me!

Your punishment is death!

Death to the hunters!

Enough of this terrible dream!

You still have dreams? Tell the little doll I said hello.

You can't go on like this…

Oh, hello there.

Perfect timing. I must warn you not to go near the tomb below Oedon Chapel in the Cathedral
Ward. Henryk, an old hunter, has gone mad. And he's my mark...

Don't go near the tomb below Oedon Chapel in the Cathedral Ward. I have business there first...

Few hunters can resist the intoxication of the hunt. Look at you, just the same as all the rest...

The hunters must die... The nightmare must end... Only I can stop this madness! The hunt makes
hunters mad!

...Ah... you monsters... All hunters must die!

That wasn't necessary of you... But you have my thanks.

We made it, with our lives. You're not bad at all. You must've killed Gascoigne as well, then? He
was falling apart. I'm sure it had to be done. But try to keep your hands clean.

A hunter should hunt beasts. Leave the hunting of hunters to me...

Oh is that you again? I'm afraid I've made a bit of a blunder. I'm just going to have a short rest.
Oh, don't worry. I've taken blood. Enough to save an old woman. No more dreams for me. This
is my last chance. What a fool I am. I'll have to tread carefully. But that thing still lies in wait.

Turn back. This is my score to settle. My prey lies in wait this way.

Don't you ever listen to your elders? No matter, you did save my life. I don't see apt for this life
anymore... ...My glory days were long ago now... Hmmm. I know... Here, for you. This too is
hunters' work, but it bears no honor. A burden you may choose to carry.

The decision is yours alone. Ahh, my eyes grow heavy... Let me rest a while...

...I'll be fine, just wait…

Gilbert, Critically Ill Man: Oh, you must be a hunter. And... not one from around here, either.
I'm Gilbert. A fellow outsider. You must have had a fine time of it. Yharnam has a special way
of treating guests. Well, I don't think I could stand if I wanted to... But I'm willing to help, if
there's anything that can be done.

This town is cursed. Whatever your reasons might be, you should plan a swift exit. Whatever can
be gained from this place, it will do more harm than good...

Paleblood, you say? Hmm... Never heard of it. But if it's blood you're interested in, you should
try the Healing Church. The church controls all knowledge on blood ministration, and all
varieties of blood. Across the valley to the East of Yharnam Iies the town of the Healing Church,
known as the Cathedral Ward. And deep within Cathedral Ward is the old grand cathedral. ...the
birthplace of the Healing Church‘s special blood, or so they say. Yharnamites don't share much
with outsiders. Normally, they wouldn't let you near the place, but... The hunt is on tonight. This
might be your chance...

Across the vaIley to the East of Yharnam, you'll find the Cathedral Ward. Deep within lies the
old main cathedral, said to be the source of blood. I haven't heard of Paleblood, but... That's your
best bet if it's anything to do with unique types of blood...

Yes, I see... But the great bridge is the only way to the Cathedral Ward. And during the hunt, the
bridge is closed... Hmm... You could try the aqueduct? There's a rather, how shall I put it,
colorful area south of the great bridge. From there, an aqueduct leads to the Cathedral Ward. Not
a place you'd normally want to visit, but... I don't imagine you have much of a choice. Do you?

An aqueduct leads from the town, south of the main bridge to the Cathedral Ward. Not a place
you'd normally choose to visit, but... Not much of a choice, with the bridge closed...
Have I heard of Byrgenwerth? Hmm... Afraid I can't say that I have. The locals aren't apt to share
any local history. I'm afraid I may not be of help for much longer...

Hmm... I know nothing of a Byrgenwerth, and I'm afraid I may not be of help for much longer.
Ahh, you needn't concern yourself with me. I'm afraid l‘m of little help now. But before I... Take
this... I made no use of it, but perhaps you...

What afflicted me was incurable, but this town gave me hope... Their strange blood bought me
time. I was most fortunate. Unharmed by the plague of beasts. I can even die human...

Ahh, don't you worry about me.

Why... me... why... Dear gods, what have I done? Save me, please... Save me...

Mm? Is something wrong? Stop this nonsense at once. So, you've gone over the edge. A terrible
pity. Just another Yharno now.

Imposter Iosefka: Oh, well, hello....Splendid. Let me ask you a small kindness. You're soon off
to hunt, I presume? Then, if you find any survivors, tell them to seek Iosefka's Clinic.
Upon my Hippocratic oath, if they are yet human, I will look after them, perhaps even cure them.

This sickness, these beasts, they are not to be feared. This time the night is long. I might be
trapped here, but I should do something to help. I'll even offer a reward for your cooperation.
Tempted? Well, off you go then.

If you find anyone who’s still human, send them straight to Iosefka clinic. You can assure them,
there’s no place safer. Please do me this service.

Oh, hello. You made it. Find any survivors? Or only beasts? Tell anyone who's human about
Iosefka's Clinic. I will take proper care of them. They're in your hands, and soon, mine....

Oh hello...You're all right. Very good. She's safe with me now, I presume you're to thank? The
treatment is going well, stabilized, for the most part. Fascinating, really....Here you are, as
promised.

Oh, thank goodness you came....Be a dear, find me some more. Hehehe..

There may yet be humans out there. If you find them, send them to Iosefka's Clinic. I endeavor to
treat every survivor there is. So please, be a saint.

Oh hello.....You're safe. What a relief. He's safe with me now. I'm thrilled to have another. Here
you are, as promised.

What would I ever do without you? You're really making a difference...Hahaha

Oh, hello...You're still alive. Any luck then? Finding anyone who hasn't turned? If you do, you
know where to send them.

Ahh! Can't anyone comprehend?! That'll be quite enough of you then. Isn't it time someone put
you out of your misery?

Ah, moonlit scents....How did you worm your way in here? Well, I won't make any excuses.
Would you mind leaving us alone? Things need not change...You'll do the rescuing, and I'll do
the saving. But, if you refuse to leave...

Ah, well...I always wanted to try my hand on a hunter...

This won't hurt a bit...I'll soon have you right as rain...

Hush, hush....Stay still....This won't hurt a bit... I'll soon have you right as
rain...Just.....Die... ...Enough of you! Now, stop that!

Curse this oblivious fool…

Oh, how exciting! I've never worked on a hunter before…

Oh, hello... Still alive, are you? I need more patients... There aren't many humans left, I know,
but find me every last one you can. We must find a way. To surpass our own stupidity. You're
one of the bright ones. Don't you see how much this means?

If you find any humans, bring them to me. I'm depending on you, brave hunter.

Oh hello....You're alive. Good. I've received another patient. This time, I'll be trying old blood.
I've achieved much. And I owe it all to you. Take this, as thanks.

Custom made. And cheers, to the discovery of kinship. Doesn't it make you feel warm inside?

Please....find me some more. I'm depending on you, brave hunter.

Oh hello....You're still alive. But I suppose we're nearing the end. I don't imagine there are any
left who haven't turned by now. Tragic, really, but what's to be done....

God I'm nauseous... Have you ever felt this? It's progressing. I can see things... I knew it, I'm
different. I'm no beast... I... Oh... God, it feels awful... but, it proves that I'm chosen. Don't you
see? How they writhe, writhe inside my head... It's... rather... rapturous…

Father Gascoigne: ...Beasts all over the shop…You’ll be one of them...Sooner or later…

…What's that smell? The sweet blood, oh, it sings to me. It's enough to make a man sick...

Too proud to show your true face, eh? But a sporting hunt, it was!

Oedon Chapel Dweller: ...Hmm? Oh... you must be... a hunter. Very sorry, the incense must've
masked your scent. Good, good. I've been waiting for one of your ilk. These hunts have everyone
all locked up inside. Waiting for it to end... It always does, always has, y'know. Since forever.

But it won't end very nicely, not this time. Even some folks hiding inside are goin' bad. The
screams of wimminfolk, the stench of blood, the snarls of beasts... none of em‘s too uncommon
now. Yharnam's done fer, I tell ya.

But if you spot anyone with their wits about ‘em... Tell ‘em about this here Oedon Chapel.
They'll be safe here. The incense wards off the beasts. Spread the word... tell ‘em to come on
over. If you wouldn't mind... Hee hee…

...Hmm? Oh... you must be... a hunter. I know I shouldn't be askin‘ you, but... If you happen
upon someone while hunting, tell ‘em about this here Oedon Chapel. If they seem worth being
told, that is... Oh, and I do sincerely hope they are... hee hee hee hee hee...

Ahh, the hunter. Alive and well, are ya? This here's a safe place. Stay as long as you like. But...
next time you're out on a hunt, remember what I asked. If you find any sane survivors, tell ‘em to
seek shelter at Oedon Chapel. Cause there's nothing to fear here... ha, hah ha!

Ahh, the hunter. Alive and well, are ya?

Ahh, the hunter! Thank you. So, that survivor, you told 'im about this place right? Well, he don't
offer me much in the way of conversation, but still... I'd rather see 'im alive anyhow. And... I sort
of hoped that, my asking you, turned out to, you know, help ‘em out in the end... I've never been
of any use to anyone, you see... Just, happy about it, is all... ha, ha

Ahh, the hunter! Thank you. So, that survivor, you told 'im about this place, right? If you find
any sane survivors, well... Send ‘em along to Oedon Chapel, will ya?

Ahh, the hunter. Alive and well, at that! Another one you sent made it here safe and sound. This
place is a haven now, for so many. Thanks to you. I'm... overjoyed, really. That you'd even give
me the time o‘ day! I don't suppose there's anybody out there worth savin' anymore. But you did
all ya could, and so many owe you so much. Amazing, really. Not ‘cause you're a hunter, but
because you're you.

Makes me think, once dawn breaks, maybe I can just, you know, start over. Makes it easier to
bear all o‘ this, you see? You've made life easier. Thank you.

If you please, kind hunter... When the night of the hunt passes, s'pose, we could be friends,

yes, perhaps so, but, well... Give it a thought, if you wouldn't mind, o' course... If you please,

Ahh, kind hunter! There ain't no more survivors, there can't be... Yharnam's done for... Oh, kind
hunter... How did this happen? A beast, here... why...? It's my fault... Savaged and eaten, every
one, and it's all my fault... Gods, please, I'm sorry, so sorry... Oh, kind hunter... I only wanted to

Oh, kind hunter! Thank you. So, that lady, you told ‘er about this place? Oh, kind hunter! Thank
you. So, that man, you told 'im about this place? Well, he keeps ‘is distance an‘ all, but... I

Lonely Old Dear: Oh, you're a hunter, aren't ya? Then, well, do you know of any safe places?

Ohh, how did we ever get into this mess... Oh, the good old days, what a laugh, eh?

Mother'll make everything better...

pathetic idea. Well, away with ya! Oh, enough of you... What, you think this is funny? Well I
certainly don't. So be gone with ya! I'll have nothing to do with your beast hunts.

Oh, enough with you already. Come on, just go, will ya? What's this two-bit nonsense you're
peddlin'? I heard you told that wench about some shelter. Well, she's a damn fool to trust an
outsider. Why? Her sort's probably just fixin' to thieve some of your coin.

All right, what crafty lies does the outsider have today? You think I'm an easy mark? Yeah?
Well, give me your best shot.

Hmph... Yeah sorry, too sharp for that bollocks. I know a superstition when I hear one.
Outsiders... even their lies are predictable.

What, afraid your lies will be exposed? Yeah, I knew you'd back off, I just knew it.

Yeah, an outsider, you may be, but at least you know when you're bested.

What? Still preying on folks with your book of lies? Yeah, fine, come on. Show me what you've
got. Tell me about your little safe place.

What? You just can't help yourself, can ya? Go on then, fine, go on... tell me about it. Your little
safe haven. Ah, you, the swindlin' offcomer. Did you really think that'd work? There's no fooling
me! Now, off with ya, you heard me! Go away! I can't stand the stench of your lyin' breath!

Ah, you, the swindlin' offcomer. Did you really think that'd work? There's no fooling me! Go
away! I can't stand the stench of your Iyin' breath!

I've no time for your petty lies.

Away, just away with you, now! I mean it! And don't you come back, do you hear me! Don't
come back! Oh, give it a rest, please. I've no time for your petty lies. Awa- just go away now! I
can't stand the stench of your lyin' breath!

I'll spare you one nugget of advice. Beware the lady of the night. I can see it in her eyes. She
deeply resents the young saint. She hears people whisper. She knows what people think of her.
Yes, she despises the saint for having what she doesn't. Bloody wench, they shoulda moved her
on ages ago.

I'll spare you one nugget of advice. Beware the blind man. There the beggar sits, at the bottom of
the bloody food chain… …and then he's here, acting like he owns the place... He's not to be
trusted. What's he want with all those people anyway. That little weasel has a murky past, I'm
tellin' ya...

Now, be gone! Go, away with ya! Don't ever bother me again! An outsider won't get far
behaving like that.

Ahh, your lies spin a web... But I see through your deceit! I did not learn from books. No, no, no,
no, no... I learned it all with my own mind...

Bloody offcomer... curse you...

Adella, Nun of the Healing Church: Oh, merciful gods, help me... In the name of the Healing
Church, cleanse us of this horrible dream...

Please, leave me be... Don't take me... please... Oh, please, dear gods...

Ahh, by your garb... the Healing Church... You've come to save me... Ahh! Thank you, dear
saint! I have no words to express my relief... You could take this, at least. It is sure to please an
upstanding member of the church like you.

Ahh, thank you so much. I was seized on the street by a hulking brute in the Cathedral Ward and
locked up here. There were many others, but they've been taken away... And I've heard moans,
echoing in the distance, ever since...

So, the hunt is on tonight? Then the streets are perilous... And every door will be shut tight...
Perhaps it isn't my place to ask, but... Do you know somewhere that might take me in?

Oh, thank you so much. I'll set out as soon as I can. I pray for success on your hunt.

Kind hunter... I'll set out as soon as I can. I pray for success on your hunt.

Kind hunter... Yes, I see... I understand. Such are the perils on a night of the hunt. I'll ask an
acquaintance in the Cathedral Ward. Perhaps he'II open his door for me... perhaps.

You're... a hunter, aren't you? I'll be fine. I don't wish to trouble you any further. I'll ask an
acquaintance in the Cathedral Ward. Unless, y-you know of another place?

Oh, brave hunter. You're alive. Thank you very much. The town is in disarray, but there are still
people here. Together, we await the help of the Healing Church. I cannot begin to express my
gratitude to you. The only thing that I can offer... Is my own lowly blood. If it would suffice...

Oh, brave hunter. You're alive. Yes, of course. Come in close... Now... take my blood...

Brave hunter. Please, give me a little more time. There are others in need of my blood.

Brave hunter. Please, give me a little more time.

Ahh, brave hunter. You're safe. Do you wish... to have my blood?

Ahh, brave hunter. You're safe. Forgive me, I... I should have known better. What would a brave
hunter do with lowly blood like mine? Please, forget I even asked. What would a brave hunter do
with lowly blood like mine?

Ahh, brave hunter. What is it? Have you renewed thoughts on this matter? Forgive me. I must
cease this nonsense. Forget I ever offered.

I pray for your safety.

Oh, forgive me. I need more time...

Oh, brave hunter, you‘ve returned, unharmed. Don't you want to be treated... with blood? I only
wish to be of help.

What have I done...

Tee hee... My sweet hunter... Your blood is tainted... I can't... ha... I can't help myself... hahaha
haha...

I will never leave your side…

Alfred, Hunter of Vilebloods: You're a beast hunter, aren't you? I knew it. That's precisely how
I started out! Oh, beg pardon, you may call me Alfred. Protégé of Master Logarius, hunter of
Vilebloods. So, what say you? Our prey might differ, but we are hunters, the both of us. Why not
cooperate, and discuss the things we've learned?

Oh-hoh! Very good, very good indeed! Take this, to celebrate our acquaintance. Beast hunting is
a sacred practice. May the good blood guide your way.

Well, that's most unfortunate. But, if you have a change of heart, you know where to come. We
are, after all, fellow hunters, and tonight we hunt!

Oh, changed our mind, have we? Then perhaps we can cooperate, and discuss what we've
learned. There must be oodles for us to share. Go on, just tell me what piques your interest.

Oh-hoh! Good to see you safe. Now, let's think up something to discuss. Just tell me what piques
your interest.

As you know, the Healing Church is the fountainhead of blood healing. Well, I'm a simple
hunter, quite unfamiliar with the ins and outs of the institution. But I have heard that the holy
medium of blood healing is venerated in the main cathedral. And that

councilors of the old church reside in the high stratum of the Cathedral Ward. If you seek blood
healing, and the church is willing, you should pay them a visit.

Byrgenwerth is an old place of learning. And the tomb of the gods, carved out below Yharnam,
should be familiar to every hunter. Well, once a group of young Byrgenwerth scholars
discovered a holy medium deep within the tomb. This led to the founding of the Healing Church,
and the establishment of blood healing. In this sense, everything sacred in Yharnam can be
traced back to Byrgenwerth. But today, the college lies deep within a tangled wood, abandoned
and decrepit. And furthermore, the Healing Church has declared Byrgenwerth forbidden ground.
It's unclear how many of its scholars remain alive… ...but only they know the password that
allows passage through the gate.

Ahh, there's something I want to tell you. A bit of wisdom from the eminent Master Logarius.
Once, a scholar betrayed his fellows at Byrgenwerth… …and brought forbidden blood back with
him to Cainhurst Castle. It was there that the first of the inhuman Vilebloods was born. The
Vilebloods are fiendish creatures who threaten the purity of the Church's blood healing. The
Ruler of the Vilebloods is still alive today. And so, to honor my master's wishes, I search. For the
path to Cainhurst Castle.

In his time, Master Logarius led his executioners into Cainhurst Castle to cleanse it of the
Vilebloods. But all did not go well, and Master Logarius became a blessed anchor, guarding us
from evil. ...Tragic, tragic times… that Master Logarius should be abandoned in the accursed
domain of the Vilebloods. I must free him, so that he may be properly honored in martyrdom.

Ah-hah! ls that... the sigil of Cainhurst? I've heard tell of Cainhurst nobles, and their amusingly
pompous invitations. Wonderful! I thank you profusely... I will depart immediately. But first, a
token of my gratitude.

Ahh, I feel my master's hand at work. Praise the good blood! And let us cleanse these tarnished
streets.

It has been an honor, but I must say good-bye. Let us cleanse these tarnished streets. And may
the good blood guide your way.

Master, look! I've done it, I've done it! I smashed and pounded and grounded this rotten siren
into fleshy pink pulp! There, you filthy monstrosity! What good's your immortality now! Try

Just what is the meaning of this? Why turn your blade on me? You're jealous! Aren't you!

Pray for Master Logarius in my stead..

A hunter's grudge is an awful thing. You must find your own way on this hunt. As I have mine.

Ha ha ha ha ha! Hah hah hah hah hah!

Unclean wench! Vile monstrosity!

Bloody fool! Has the blood gone to your head?

Pathetic! As you deserve! The blood! You've spilled my blood!

You'll... regret this...

You let the blood get the best of you... Heh heh heh...

Vicar Amelia: Seek the old blood. Let us pray, let us wish. To partake in communion. Let us
partake in communion, and feast upon the old blood. Our thirst for blood satiates us, soothes our
fears. Seek the old blood. But beware the frailty of men. Their wills are weak, minds young. The
foul beasts will dangle nectar, and lure the meek into the depths. Remain wary of the frailty of
men. Their wills are weak, minds young. Were it not for fear, death would go unlamented.

Djura: You there, hunter. Didn't you see the warning? Turn back at once. Old Yharnam, burned
and abandoned by men, is now home only to beasts. They are of no harm to those above. Turn
back… …or the hunter will face the hunt…

...You are a skilled hunter. Adept, merciless, half-cut with blood. As the best hunters are. Which
is why I must stop you!

I should think you still have dreams? Well, the next time you dream, give some thought... to the
hunt, and its purpose...

Well, well... How did you get in here? Ah, it's no matter. What brings you to Old Yharnam? I've
no interest in matters further up, but you must not disturb this place. The beasts do not venture
above, and mean no harm to anyone. If you still insist on hunting them, then I will hunt you first.
You understand me?

Yes, very good. I no longer dream, but I was once a hunter, too. There's nothing more horrific
than a hunt. In case you've failed to realise... The things you hunt, they're not beasts. They're
people. One day, you will see... Hmm, it's time you got going... But first, a farewell gift. I have
no use for it anyway.
What is it? Surely I need not repeat myself. Go, I say. You have the whole night to dream. Make
the best of it.

Of course, I thought as much. You are a true hunter. Which is why I must stop you!

You devious rat! The makings of a true hunter, this fellow/lass! Very well. Then there's no need
to hold back! The beasts will feast tonight!

Is it the blood, or are you just raving mad?

When the frail of heart joins the fray... The hunter becomes the hunted!

Then come as often as you like, and I will show you another death.

...lt's you... you're the beast... Just think about what you're doing. It's utter madness…

Gascoigne’s Younger Daughter: Who... are you? I don't know your voice, but I know that
smell... Are you a hunter? Then, please, will you look for my mum? Daddy never came back
from the hunt, an d she went to find him, but now she's gone, too... I'm all alone... and scared...

Really? Oh, thank you! My m-mum wears a red jeweled brooch. It's so big and... a nd beautiful.
You won't miss it. Oh, I mustn't forget. If you find my mum, give her this music box. ...It plays
one of daddy's favorite songs. And when daddy forgets us we play it for him so he remembers.
Mum's so silly, running off without it!

Oh, alright... Well th-thanks mister/miss hunter, for talking, at least. Take care, on your hunt.

Thanks for chatting. Please be careful out there! Hello, [mister/miss] hunter. Still can't find my
mum?

Yes, okay. I can wait. Mum knows I'm really brave, and you're very kind. I won't be afraid, I'll
be a good girl, I promise.

Oh, okay. I can wait. But isn't there something I can do? Maybe mum and dad are stuck out
there… …waiting for me to come and find them. What do you think, mister/miss hunter?

Yes, okay! Thank you, mister/miss hunter. I love you almost as much as mum and dad, and
granddad!

Yes, I see... I can wait. I won't be afraid. I know, I do. The morning always comes.

Mum, come home... I'm alone... I'm scared... It's not fair...

Mister/Miss hunter... was it really her? ...Mummy... mummy... Don't leave me alone...

Gascoigne’s Eldest Daughter: Oh, you haven't by any chance... seen my little sister, have you?
I told her to look after the house, but she's run off somewhere. She's still quite small, and wears a
big white ribbon. Have you seen her out there anywhere?

Oh, how did this happen... Why would she ever go outside? At least... I'll have something to
remember her by.

What a perfect ribbon... And now it's mine... I can't wait to try it on...

Oh, it's wonderful...

Oh, okay then. But if you do see her, would you give me word? She's a small girl, with a big
white ribbon. My good little sister...

Oh, back again? Any news of my sister?

Gatekeeper: The password... The password...

Patches: Oh, a hunter of beasts, are you? Glory be. You know not the value you possess. But,

Ha, a most frightful fate, oh my. But I'm willing to do you a kindness. Step lightly round to the
right of the great cathedral, and seek an ancient, shrouded church. The gift of the godhead will
grant you strength... Yes, I'm unquestionably certain, heheh…

Oh Amygdala, oh Amygdala... Have mercy on the poor bastard...

What a joy it is, to behold the divine. It must be such a pleasure. You're in my debt, you know.
You're nigh on a beast of the field, but here you are, treading a measure with the gods. Are your
feet as fat as your Wits? Oh, cease this dithering! Take the plunge! Throw yourself to the
wolves!

Don't dally, you lucky scamp! The gift of the godhead cometh! Oh, this cannot be, you cannot
be... No, you didn't... lord Amygdala… ...How did this come to pass?

Hmph! Now, wait just a moment... Do you think ill of me, me?

Oh, it pains me to hear it. You've made yourself a misreckoning. I shared with you a thing most
secret. Now you're witness to a miracle, and all the stronger for it! It‘s plain as a pikestaff. Now,
say in my heart, you were as a lamb to my god. Well, you weren't to know, and it wasn't for you
to know. All's well, that ends well, I say.

You should appreciate it, if you’ve a grain of gratitude in you! Appreciate it!

No matter. Such details are trifling. We're fast friends by now. Let this express what words
cannot.

Oh, doubt me not, sweet compeer. What is friendship, but a chance encounter?

Ahh, well met. My apologies, but I feel a profound thought occurring... On the good grace of a
certain god, and the way he meted out his love.

Ahh, well met. This is a most pleasing encounter. You see, I must depart erelong. My god is lost
to me, so I must go away to find another. If the fates are kind, our paths may cross again. Sooner
still... if you were you to take the leap...

Ahh, well met. Oh, think not of poor Amygdala. Upon that piteous bastard, you bestowed
salvation. All‘s well that ends well.

Kneel afore Us… or get thee gone.

Visitor... Moon-scented hunter... I am Annalise, Queen of Castle Cainhurst. Ruler of the
Vilebloods, and sworn enemy of the church. Yet, Our people are murdered, and We are prisoner
to this wretched mask. What is it thou'rt in search of?

Visitor... Moon-scented hunter... Speak thy mind.

Well, well... An odd hunter thou art indeed... We've tired of these piteous nights... Share in Our
plight, and take oath against the church. If thou wouldst this path walk… l prithee partake of my
rotted blood.

An odd hunter thou art indeed... Very well. Drink deep of Our blood. Feel the spreading
corruption burn. Now, thou'rt too a Vileblood. We two, the very last on this earth.

A wise choice... There is no more to be said. Away from mine gaze.

Such impudence. Defiled, are We, yet still Queen. We shall not give audience to an ill-mannered
beast. We shall not give audience to an ill-mannered beast. Get thee gone.

Closest of kin, bearer of Our blood. I welcome thee. What is thy wish?

Closest of kin, last of Our kind. I welcome thee. What is thy wish?

More talk to be had?

Thy gift pleases Us. Let this reward be thine. Indulge thyself in Our tainted blood.

Speak not, those words. We have little need of a consort. Such a path would belike lead to
further ruin. Thou'rt dear to Us. We would see no harm befall thee...

Ahh, still thy honeyed tongue... The thought alone sufficeth. Thy worth is too great. Now, speak
no more on the matter.

Honestly!

Arrant fool. Vileblood or no, forget not; We are thy Queen. Bend the knee.

Vileblood or no, respect will be shown.

We await thy return. For the honor of Cainhurst.

We await thy return. ...This chamber was made not for one alone...

How sad this is. If only Our life was so easily forfeit...

Art thou brave, or merely lacking in wit? It matters not. Our flesh is undying. Speak thy mind.

Well, well. Thou wearest a second face. It matters not. Our flesh is undying. Speak thy mind.

Valtr, Master of the League: Ahh, a new face, are you? And an accomplished hunter... it would
appear. I am Valtr, Master of the League. Members of the League cleanse the streets of all the
filth that's spread about during the hunt. Like any half-decent hunter ought to, you know?

Haven't you seen enough of these wretched beasts, freakish slugs, and mad doctors?

Sentence these fiends to death. With the help of your League confederates. What do you say?
Why not join the League?

Yes. As a hunter well should. Commit this to heart. Our own Caryll rune, symbol of the League.
The nights brims with defiled scum, and is permeated by their rotten stench. Just think. Now
you're all set to hunt and kill to your heart's content. Hunt in co-operation with your fellows, your
League confederates.

Yes, I suppose... I should not force your will. But you are a hunter, and will see soon enough.

That on a night of the hunt, no, on any night, nothing out there deserves to live.

Well, then? Seen enough out there? Fancy joining the ranks of the League?

Now, there is one thing you must know. By the oath of the League, those who bear its rune will
see vermin. Vermin writhe deep within all filth, and are the root of man's impurity. ...All vermin
are to be crushed. The League exists to expunge all vermin, ridding us of any trace of human
corruption. And so, until we are rid of all vermin, you must continue to hunt and kill. This
bloody fate is ours alone. Do not expect the world to grasp our work... But remember, the
confederates will always have my blessing... And each other. Always.

Ahh, how goes your hunt? Do not forget the League's mission. To co-operate with confederates,
find vermin, and stamp them out.

Ahh, very good. You've crushed some vermin. I am the Master of the League, I can see it in your
eyes. I'm pleased. This makes you a true fellow of the League. ...A confederate. Now, take this
staff. A symbol of our oath, of our blood-drenched fate. You'll be welcomed as a true
confederate. Go forth, with renewed vigor. ...In short time, you will see... How the mission takes
hold of one's spirits.

Hello, confederate. Has your stomach not turned? Turned at the world of man, so wondrously
wretched! And brimming with unsightly vermin. Much like our very own mission.

Hello, confederate. Your eyes say it all. You've crushed vermin time and time again... You've
seen the filth that varnishes the world of man... Yet you are unbroken, you've the eyes of a
hunter. You have blessed the League with your presence. This was my last, most pressing task...

My confederate. Promise me you'll crush all vermin, to rid us of our impurities. For the sake of
our fellows, all blood-stained hunters of the League. My confederate. Promise me you'll crush all
vermin, to rid us of our impurities.

Well, how quaint. You scoff at the League? Then you are yourself a beast. A defiled mess of
rotten flesh!

When you are dead, your rank blood will curdle with vermin!

Look, look, I knew it! Vermin writhe and squirm... You vile lout.

My time is done... Glory to my League confederates…

Suspicious Beggar: Blimey, don't scare me like that! On a night like this... I took you for a
monster. Oh, thank the stars, you're fairly normal... Was it you put down that awful beast? Oh,
that thing had me trembling, frozen in me boots. And then you came along. Well, if you're a
hunter... then... would you know of any safe havens?

Well, I'll be! Thank you! It's about time I made a move. I can't very well stay out on me own...

Oh, you've given me hope... Terribly kind of you. Take this. It's all I can offer as thanks.

Oh yeah, of course not... I should've known. This whole place's falling apart, once again... It's the
curse of Yharnam...

Thank you. It's about time I made a move. I can't very well stay out on me own... Oh, you again!

You find any nice, cozy places to hole up in? You find any nice, cozy places to hole up in?

Ah, hello again. I owe this to you. It's a wonderful place. They even let beggars like meself in!
What's better... we keep our distance, don't step on anyone's toes, right? The way proper
Yharnamites ought to live! Oh, let me share something with you. My secret stash. Really prime
stuff...

Oh, hello again. I really do owe you a terrible lot. Finding me such a nice place to Iive...

Oh, hi. I'm afraid I don't have any more. Yeah, it's all sold out. Sorry, chum. But, you know... I'll
try and get some more soon. But, you know it ain't easy, right? Yeah, it's all sold out. Sorry,
chum.

Oh, you again. Perfect timing. I've got some more. See? Oh, oh my... you just can‘t get enough.
Oh no, I understand, I'm the very same. This is a smashing place. It‘s everything Yharnam ever
had, and more!

Have you got a screw loose? Or is it your... animal intuition? Oh, it doesn't even matter. You
hunters've got more blood on your hands! Oh, you are a sick puppy! You drink the blood of half
the town, and now this! And you talk of beasts? You hunters are the real killers!

Oh, you are a sick puppy!

Die! Die, die! Hunters are killers, nothing less! You call me a beast? A beast? What would you
know? I didn't ask for this! You're no different than I. Rancid beasts, every last one of us…

Bloody Corpse: Ahh, ahh, please… help us… Ah… An unsightly beast… a great terror looms!
Ahh! Ludwig the Accursed is coming! Have mercy! Have mercy upon us!

Ludwig, the Holy Blade: Aah, you were at my side, all along. My true mentor... My guiding
moonlight...

Good hunter, have you seen the thread of light? Just a hair, a fleeting thing, yet I clung to it,
steeped as I was in the stench of blood and beasts. I never wanted to know, what it really was.
Really, I didn't.

Tell me, good hunter of the Church. Have you seen the light? Are my Church hunters the
honorable spartans I hoped they would be?

Ahh, good... that is a relief. To know I did not suffer such denigration for nothing. Thank you
kindly. Now I may sleep in peace. Even in this darkest of nights, I see... the moonlight...

Oh, my. Just as I feared. Then a beast-possessed degenerate was I, as my detractors made
eminently clear. Does the nightmare never end?!

Yamamura: Shrouded by night, but with steady stride. Colored by blood, but always clear of
mind. Proud hunter of the Church.

Beasts are a curse, and a curse is a shackle. Only ye are the true blades of the Church.

Simon the Harrowed: You're a hunter with your sanity, aren't you? Must've taken a wrong turn
then, eh? Well, we're more alike than you think. This is the Hunter's Nightmare, where hunters
end up when drunk with blood. You've seen them before. Aimless, wandering hunters, slavering
like beasts. This is what the poor fools have to look forward to. So, don't be brash, turn back
before it's too late. Unless, you've something of an interest in nightmares?

Ahh, yes, I see... You sense a secret within the Nightmare, and cannot bear to leave it be. As if
the spirit of Byrgenwerth lives on within you! Such inquisitive hunters will relish the Nightmare.
If anyone deserves to have this, it is you. But beware, secrets are secrets for a reason. And some
do not wish to see them uncovered. Especially when the secrets are particularly unseemly...

Yes, as it should be. Hunt your beasts, and think no more on the secrets of the night. That is the
very best a hunter can do. Just don't let the blood intoxicate you.

What now? Take my word, and turn back before it's too late. Unless, I suppose, you've taken an
interest in nightmares?

Oh, he's well and truly gone, now. A tragic figure. But he will shame himself no longer. He died
with his ideals untarnished. He was a true hero, and earnt that much, at least.

Here, this is Ludwig's guiding light. The blinding thread that led, and misled, that consummate
hero. The poor brute.

A tragic figure. But he will shame himself no longer. He died with his ideals untarnished. He was
a true hero, and earnt that much, at least.

Do you know why the Hunters are drawn to this Nightmare? Because it sprouted from their very
misdeeds. Things that some would rather keep secret. A pitiful tale of petty arrogance, really.
High time someone exposed the whole charade.

Now, now, go on ahead. You seek nightmares, and the secrets within, do you not?
Oh, hello. Not a pretty sight, is it? The true face of the blood-worshipping, beast-purging Healing
Church. But that's not all. You seek the secrets held by the Nightmare, do you not? Then here's
what you must do. ...Climb the Astral Clocktower, and kill Maria. She hides the real secret...

Go on, kill Maria atop the Astral Clocktower. She hides the real secret...

...Oh, you, I'm afraid, I've made a botch of things... ...I can hear the bell, now... ...The beast-hide
assassin, he's after me... ...Again and again... ...It never ends...

...Please, I need you to do something... ...This village is the true secret. Testament to the old
sins... ...It feeds this Hunter's Nightmare... ...Please, bring to an end the horror...

...So our forefathers sinned? ...We hunters cannot bear their weight forever... ...It isn't fair, it just
isn't fair...

Tsk! Taken by the Nightmare, are you? Then I've no choice. Prepare yourself!

Terribly sorry, but I couldn't let you stop me...

Curses. What a rotten place to die...

Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower: Oh, I know very well, how the secrets beckon so
sweetly. Only an honest death will cure you now. Liberate you, from your wild curiosity.

Brador, Church Assassin: Are you a hunter? Well, that's very odd. Do you hear the toll of the
bell?

Hmph. Liar. Such pettiness will be your undoing. The beasts you seek will not be found here. Go
back to your hunt, and if you have the chance, put this night behind you. ...places better left
untouched, secrets better left alone... ...only a fool would so brazenly roam...

Very well. The beasts you seek will not be found here. Go back to your hunt, and if you have the
chance, put this night behind you. ...places better left untouched, secrets better left alone... ...only
a fool would so brazenly roam...

Bear in mind. Some places are better left untouched, and some secrets are better left
alone. ...only fools do brazenly roam...

Do you hear this? Fear the bell's toll. For only death awaits foolish prying eyes, and the Church
assassins are never far behind.

Well, well, look who's here. Welcome to my quarters. I've never entertained a guest before. Are
you going to kill me? After all you've done, kill me, as if to right your wrongs?

What is it? Aren't you going to kill me? Or perhaps, beg my forgiveness? Well, leave off. What's
done is done.

Nothing changes, such is the nature of men...

...unending death awaits those who pry into the unknown...

Fishing Hamlet Priest: Byrgenwerth... Byrgenwerth... Blasphemous murderers... Blood-crazed
fiends... Atonement for the wretches... By the wrath of Mother Kos... Mercy for the poor,
wizened child... Mercy, oh please...

Atonement for the wretches... Lay the curse of blood upon them, and their children, and their
children's children, for evermore. Each wretched birth will plunge each child into a lifetime of
misery.

Mercy for the poor, wizened child... Let the pungence of Kos cling, like a mother's devotion...

Curse here, curse there. A curse for he, and she, why care. A bottomless curse, a bottomless sea,
source of all greatness, all things that be. Listen for the baneful chants. Weep with them, as one
in trance. And weep with us, oh, weep with us...
A call to the bloodless, wherever they be. A call to the bloodless, wherever they be. Fix your
ears, to hear our calls.

...Ahh, sweet child of Kos, returned to the ocean... A bottomless curse, a bottomless sea.
Accepting of all that there is and can be.

Plain Doll: Ahh, you've found yourself a hunter...

Hello, good hunter. I am a doll, here in this dream to look after you. Honorable hunter, pursue
the echoes of blood, and I will channel them into your strength. You will hunt beasts... and I will
be here for you, to embolden your sickly spirit.

Welcome home, good hunter. What is it you desire?

Welcome home, good hunter. Very well, let the echoes become your strength. Let me stand
close. Now shut your eyes...

Farewell, good hunter. May you find your worth in the waking world.

Did you speak with Gehrman? He was a hunter long, long ago, but now serves only to advise
them. He is obscure, unseen in the dreaming world. Still, he stays here, in this dream… ...such is
his purpose...

Ahh, the little ones, inhabitants of the dream... They find hunters like yourself, worship, and
serve them. Speak words, they do not, but still, aren't they sweet?

Over time, countless hunters have visited this dream. The graves here stand in their memory. It
all seems so long ago now...

Hunters have told me about the church. About the gods, and their love. But... do the gods love
their creations? I am a doll, created by you humans. Would you ever think to love me? Of
course... I do love you. Isn't that how you've made me?

Good hunter... Your presence somehow soothes... I sense the ancient echoes, they course your
veins...

What... what is this? I-I can't remember, not a thing, only... I feel... A yearning... something I've
never felt before... What's happening to me? Ahh... Tell me hunter, could this be joy?
Good hunter, you have come... Dawn will soon break... This night, and this dream, will end.
Gehrman awaits you, at the foot of the great tree. Go on, good hunter...

Farewell, good hunter. May you find your worth in the waking world.

And so, the hunt begins again.

Are you cold...? Oh, good hunter.

O Flora, of the moon, of the dream. O little ones, O fleeting will of the ancients... Let the hunter
be safe, let him/her find comfort. And let this dream, his/her captor… foretell a pleasant
awakening… be, one day, a fond, distant memory...

Welcome home, good hunter. I must have drifted off... What is it you desire?

Ahh, welcome home, good hunter. That I may channel into your strength. Very well, let the
echoes of blood become your strength.

Good hunter. This may sound strange, but... Have I somehow changed? Moments ago, from
some place, perhaps deep within, I sensed a liberation from heavy shackles.

Not that I would know... How passing strange...

Oh, good hunter. I can hear Gehrman sleeping. On any other night, he'd be restless. But on this
night, he sounds so very calm. ...Perhaps something has eased his suffering.

Gehrman, The First Hunter: Ah-hah, you must be the new hunter. Welcome to the Hunter's
Dream. This will be your home, for now. I am... Gehrman, friend to you hunters. You're sure to
be in a fine haze about now, but don't think too hard about all of this. Just go out and kill a few
beasts. It's for your own good. You know, it's just what hunters do! You'll get used to it...

This was once a safe haven for hunters. A workshop where hunters used blood to enhance their
weapons and flesh. We don't have as many tools as we once did, but... You're welcome to use
whatever you find. ...Even the doll, should it please you...

The moon is close. It will be a long hunt tonight. If the beasts loom large, and threaten to crush
your spirits, seek a Holy Chalice. As every hunter before you has. A Holy Chalice will reveal the
tomb of the gods, ...where hunters partake in communion...

Oh, Laurence... what's taking you so long... I've grown too old for this, of little use now, I'm
afraid...

Most of the Holy Chalices lie deep within the tomb of the gods. And the few that found their way
to the surface... Were lost again in the hands of men. But if the old hunter tales remain true…
one of the Holy Chalices is worshipped in the valley hamlet. Yet the town is in disarray... It was
burned and abandoned, for fear of the scourge, home now only to beasts. The perfect place for a
hunter, wouldn't you say?

One of the Holy Chalices is worshipped in the valley hamlet. A town of beasts... the perfect
place for a hunter...

The Healing Church, and the Blood Ministers who belong to it... Were once guardians of the
hunters, in the times of the hunter... Ludwig. They worked, and forged weapons, in their unique
workshop. Today, most ministers don't recall the hunters. But they have much to offer you. And
so, heed the message of your forebears. Ascend to Oedon Chapel.

Ascend to Oedon Chapel. From there, you will find the church workshop.

...Oh, Laurence... Master Willem... Somebody, help me... Unshackle me, please, anybody... I've
had enough of this dream... The night blocks all sight... Oh, somebody, please...

Good hunter, you've done well. The night is near its end. Now, I will show you mercy. You will
die, forget the dream, and awake under the morning sun. You will be freed… from this terrible
hunter's dream... Farewell, my keen hunter. Fear the blood.

Dear oh dear, what was it? The hunt, the blood, or the horrible dream? Oh, it doesn't matter. It
always comes down to the hunters’ helper to clean up after these sorts of messes. Tonight,
Gehrman joins the hunt...

The night, and the dream, were long...

You must accept your death. Be freed from the night…

Yharnamites: Lousy offcomer. Who'd open their door on a night of the hunt! Away with you.
Now!

Are you that outsider? Well, sorry, but I don't want anything to do with ya. Trot along, willya.


Praise you... praise the whole damn church... And best of luck hunting, best luck of all!

...Bless us with blood… ...Bless us with blood...

A night of curses, a night to remember! Wouldn't you say, friend?

Help me... Please help...

Ahhhh! Stop! You stop right there! Not an inch closer!

A celebration, a great night of celebration!
Wretched outsider! Tryin' to fool me to open this door? Heavens, the depths of depravity...

I don't reckon you're from ‘round here! Well, pffft, stuck outside on a night of the hunt! Ahh, you

enough already...Please, just leave a poor old woman be...

Do you hear the graveyard murmurs? Then it's almost time. Oh, I can't wait. I just can't wait!

Oh! Ah! My baby! My precious, little baby! Stay away, stay away from us!

Research Hall Patients: ...Kill me... please, just kill me... Free me from this place... before I go
mad.

Ahh, Lady Maria, Lady Maria. Please. Take my hand. Please. Help me... don't let me drown...

Has someone, anyone, seen my eyes? I'm afraid I've dropped them in a puddle. Everything is
pale, now...

Listen close... and you, too, will hear... The sound of water... Splish, splash, splish, splash... Plip,
plop, plip, plop...

Ahh, someone... help me... I am guilty, I know. But I won't do it again, I promise. The damp
darkness... it, it frightens me... And what rises from its very depths...
Oh, Lady Maria... Save me... please... I don't hear anything... I have failed. Please, Lady Maria...

Lady Maria, I'm a robin. Will I ever curl up and become an egg? What say you, Lady Maria?
Lady Maria? Say something, anything...

Have you heard how curiously the sea churns? Like a storm, but like the rain, only gentle, like
dripping water... It bellows, from deep inside of me... Here it comes, up through my insides...
But gently, like little droplets... Splish, splash, splish, splash... Plip, plop, plip, plop...

                               Item Descriptions

Weapons:
Hunter Axe: One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly
used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt.

Retains the qualities of an axe, but offers wider
palette of attacks by transforming. Boasts a heavy


         ________________________________________________________________________
                                                                                    Script 36


blunt attack, leading to high rally potential.

No matter their pasts, beasts are no more than beasts.
Some choose this axe to play the part of executioner.

Saw Cleaver: One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly
used in the hunting business.

This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts,
transforms into a long cleaver that makes use of
centrifugal force.

The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become
a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness
the more grotesquely transformed the beast.

Saw Spear: One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly
used by those who dedicate themselves to the hunt.

This saw, effective at drawing the blood of beasts,
transforms into a medium-range spear.

The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become
a symbol of the hunt, and only grows in effectiveness
the more grotesquely transformed the beast.

Threaded Cane: One of the trick weapons of the workshop, commonly used
by hunters on their duties.

Sufficiently deadly as a rigid bladed cane, but also serves as
a whip when its blade is split into many.

Concealing the weapon inside the cane and flogging the
beasts with the whip is partly an act of ceremony, an
attempt to demonstrate to oneself that the bloodlust of the
hunt will never encroach upon the soul.

Kirkhammer: A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters.

On the one side, an easily handled silver sword.


         ________________________________________________________________________
                                                                                        Script 37


On the other, a giant obtuse stone weapon, characterized
by a blunt strike and extreme force of impact.

The Church takes a heavy-handed, merciless stance
toward the plague of beasts, an irony not lost upon the wielders of this most symbolic weapon.

Rifle Spear: A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs.

A prototype weapon serving as a simple firearm and
spear, possibly created in imitation of a lost Cainhurst weapon.

Lacks any notable functions, saving that it is the only
trick weapon with an attached gun.

Stake Driver: A trick weapon fashioned by the workshop heretics,
the Powder Kegs. Favored by the retired hunter Djura.

The stake driver, with its queerly complex design, violently
drives thick stakes into the flesh of foes.

The stake driver allows for high-damage critical attacks, but
is difficult to use and leaves its wielder wide open, but none
of this should bother a mere Powder Keg.

Ludwig’s Holy Blade: A trick weapon typically used by Healing Church hunters.

It is said that the silver sword was employed by Ludwig,
the first hunter of the church. When transformed,
it combines with its sheath to form a greatsword.

It exhibits several departures from the workshop's
design, suggesting that the Church anticipated
much larger inhuman beasts.

Blade of Mercy: A special trick weapon passed down among
hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons
of the workshop.

Splits into two when activated. The weapon's
warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral


        ________________________________________________________________________
                                                                                   Script 38


of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,
such as after a quick-stepping.

Tonitrus: A unique trick weapon contrived by Archibald, the infamous
eccentric of the Healing Church workshop.

Striking this peculiar iron morning star flail like a match
generates the same blue sparks that blanket a darkbeast.

Unfortunately, for reasons untold, the hunters of Archibald's
time did not fully take to the device.

Chikage: Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who
protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst
Castle.

When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the
Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in
scarlet hues.

However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence.

Reiterpallash: Weapon wielded by the Knights of Cainhurst.

Combines an elegant knight's sword with the peculiar
firearm wielded by the Cainhurst order.

The old nobles, long-time imbibers of blood, are no strangers
to the sanguine plague,and the disposal of beasts was a
discrete task left to their servants, or knights, as they were
called for the sake of appearances.

Logarius’ Wheel: Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners.

Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in
pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire.

Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest
their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance.

Burial Blade: Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter.

A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons
crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite,
said to have fallen from the heavens.

Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing
only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken
to another harrowing nightmare.

Beast Claw: Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.

Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast
and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive,
and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly
power.

As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within
awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with
both strength and feverish reverie.

Amygdalan Arm: The arm of a small Amygdala Great One.

Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of
any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs.

Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but
when extended, the arm quivers as if it were still alive.

Beasthunter Saif: A trick weapon used by the old hunters.

A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In
its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved
sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted,
allowing for quick, repeated stabs.

Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it
was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were
more effective at disposing of beasts.

Beast Cutter: A trick weapon wielded by the old hunters.

This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast
hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections,
allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip.

The crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably
inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters
made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine blacks and
reds.

Bloodletter: The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador,
the Healing Church assassin.

The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it
draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and
soul.

This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or
so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe.

Boom Hammer: A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the
workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs.

A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When
ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes
furiously upon impact.

Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the
Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute
distaste for beasts.

Church Pick: One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a
hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that
appears in the old beast tales.

The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when
transformed, functions as an extended war pick. In spite of
its origins, it is a highly practical weapon.

Holy Moonlight Sword: An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig.
When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it
channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave.
The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the
Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade,
and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a
very private, elusive sort.

Kos Parasite: When the carcass of Kos washed up on the coast, its insides
were teeming with tiny parasites, unlike any found in
humans.

This atypical weapon can only be clasped tight and swung,
but a Kos Parasite is said to stimulate phantasms inhabiting
a lumenwood.

Rakuyo: Hunter weapon wielded by Lady Maria of the Astral
Clocktower.

A trick sword originated in the same country as the
Cainhurst Chikage, only this sword feeds not off blood, but
instead demands great dexterity.

Lady Maria was fond of this aspect of the Rakuyo, as she
frowned upon blood blades, despite being a distant relative
of the queen.

One day, she abandoned her beloved Rakuyo, casting it into
a dark well, when she could stomach it no longer.

Simon’s Bowblade: Choice weapon of Simon, one of the first Healing Church
hunters.

Simon despised firearms, and so the Church workshop had
this specially fashioned to his liking. The large curved blade
serves as a bow when transformed.

But aside from a few close friends, Simon was scoffed at for
his choice of arms, for who would dare face the beasts with
a measly bow?

Whirligig Saw: A trick weapon crafted by the workshop heretics, the
Powder Kegs, and weapon of choice for the old hunter Valtr,
the Beast Eater.

This weapon pummels beasts in its mace form, but its true
strength lies in its attached mechanical saws.
These discs, lined with serrated teeth, spin rapidly, trashing
the flesh of beasts into fine shreds.

Hunter Blunderbuss: A blunderbuss created at the workshop for the hunters'
line of work.

Hunter firearms are specially crafted to employ Quicksilver
Bullets fused with the wielder's own blood, boosting damage
against beasts.

The impact of this highly-effective weapon counters beasts'
swift movements, and its wide spread is nigh-on guaranteed
to hit the mark.

Hunter Pistol: Pistol made at the workshop, for hunters stalking beasts.

Hunter firearms are specially crafted to employ
Quicksilver Bullets fused with the wielder's own blood,
boosting damage against beasts.

The pistol is a quicker draw than the blunderbuss,
allowing for speedier responses to attacks.

Flamesprayer: A special weapon used by certain members of the Healing
Church.
Spits searing flames by using blood-imbued Quicksilver
Bullets as a special medium.

Not the most efficient weapon by any stretch, but sometimes
a sea of flame is just what the doctor ordered.

Besides, the beasts of Yharnam can always use a good
cleansing.

Repeating Pistol: Repeating pistol typically used by Healing Church hunters.

Crafted with mostly metal parts and exhibiting a complex design,
the repeating pistol fires two shots at once,
making it a ravenous consumer of Quicksilver Bullets.

Should be used sparingly compared to its workshop counterpart,
as the trump card in one's arsenal.

Cannon: Large prototype firearms fashioned by the workshop
heretics, the Powder Kegs.

Use of this weapon is equivalent to toting a mounted
cannon, complete with its ridiculous weight, staggering
kick, and lavish use of Quicksilver Bullets, into battle.

Such a monstrosity was doomed from the start, and
indeed its development was cut short. Yet, against
impossibly gigantic foes, it might be just the thing.

Ludwig’s Rifle: A rifle typically used by Healing Church hunters.

It is said that this rifle was employed by Ludwig,
the first hunter of the Church. Its long, heavy barrel
makes up in range for what it lacks in reload speed.

Ludwig's Rifle exhibits several departures from the
workshop's design, suggesting that the Church
anticipated much larger inhuman beasts.

Evelyn: Special pistol used by Cainhurst knights.

The Evelyn uses Quicksilver Bullets, just as any workshop
firearm, but the Cainhurst variant relies more on bloodtinge.

Lovingly named after a woman and graced with an intricate
design, Evelyns were adored by Cainhurst knights.

Rosmarinus: A special weapon used by the Choir, high-ranking
members of the Healing Church.

Sprays a cloud of sacred mist, created by using
blood-imbued Quicksilver Bullets as a special medium.

Arias are heard wherever sacred mist is seen, proving
that the mist is a heavenly blessing.

"Oh, fair maiden, why is it that you weep?"

Church Cannon: An oversized weapon used by the Healing Church. a type of
cannon that fires with a curved trajectory and creates an
explosion upon impact.

Originally designed for use by brawny men with deteriorated
brains, not for just any ordinary hunter.

But the men lacked the wits to effectively operate firearms,
and the weapon was quietly ushered into permanent storage.

Fist of Gratia: A chunk of iron fitted with finger holes.

The hulking hunter woman Simple Gratia, ever hopeless
when handling hunter firearms, preferred to knock the lights
out of the beasts with this hunk of iron, which incidentally
caused heavy stagger.

Gratia was a fearsome hunter, and to onlookers, her
unrelenting pummeling appeared oddly heroic. No wonder
the weapon later assumed her name.

Piercing Rifle: A rifle engineered by the Oto Workshop, the precursor to
the workshop of the heretical Powder Kegs.

Designed for hunting on narrow streets, this rifle has been
optimized to cause perforation wounds, but is unfit for
reliably countering attacks.

Gatling Gun: This is a highly-customised, portable version of the
stationary gatling gun operated by the old hunter Djura in
Old Yharnam. It was the weapon of choice of the youngest
of Djura's three companions.

The Gatling Gun boasts exceptional rapid-firing
functionality, but is considered a cumbersome weapon, due
to its excessive weight and insatiable consumption of
Quicksilver Bullets.

Wooden Shield: A crude weapon shield used by the masses who have
arisen to join the hunt.

Hunters do not normally employ shields, ineffectual
against the strength of the beasts as they tend to be.

Shield are nice, but not if they engender passivity.

Hunter’s Torch: A torch formed by wrapping a pine resin-drenched cloth
around the end of a long stick. Once used in Old Yharnam.

Designed to incinerate beasts and victims touched by the
scourge.

Its fire damage is highly effective against beasts.

Torch: A common torch formed by wrapping a pine resin-drenched
cloth around the end of a long stick.

Hunters choose torches not only because the hunt leads
them to the darkest nooks, but also because certain creatures
they encounter are possessed of a deathly fear of flame.

Loch Shield: An artisanal shield crafted with blue glass.

Originally used to safeguard the leader presiding over a
sacred Healing Church ceremony, and later supplied to tomb
prospectors, in particular those exploring the labyrinth of
Isz.

The blue is fashioned after a lake, and the shield greatly
reduces all forms of non-physical damage.


Upgrade Materials:

which does not crystallise is called a bloodstone.

human. Seek deadlier foes if bloodstone chunks are needed.

Blood Rock: A large solid chunk that forms in coldblood.

After death, a substance in the blood hardens, and that
which does not crystallise is called a blood stone.

This is no mere chunk, it is nearly a boulder.

Few blood stones of such size have ever been discovered,
even considering the combined experience of all the hunters.

gallant duo, their partnership led to Henryk's tragically long life. Henryk's unique yellow garb is
resistant to bolt and will be of great help to any hunter who has inherited the onus of the hunt.

Cape Hunter Set: One of the standard articles of hunter attire fashioned at the workshop. A fine
piece of hunter attire that provides stable defence to anyone facing Yharnam's beastly threat.
Allows one to stalk beats unannounced, by cover of night.

Charred Hunter Garb: One of the staple articles of hunter attire, fashioned at the workshop. A
product of the scourge of the beast that once plagued Old Yharnam and culminated in the town's
fiery cleansing. The cape's dampness makes it highly resistant to fire. Wearers of this attire
hunted down victims of the scourge who survived the raging flames and stench of singed blood.

Blindfold Cap: Attire of the Choir, high-ranking members of the Healing Church. Members of
the Choir are both the highest-ranking clerics of the Healing Church, and scholars who continue
the work that began at Byrgenwerth. The eye covering indicates their debt to the teachings of
Master Willem, even though their paths diverged.

Choir Set: Attire of the Choir, high-ranking members of the Healing Church. Members of the
Choir are both the highest-ranking clerics of the Healing Church, and scholars who continue the
work that began at Byrgenwerth. Together with the left behind Great One, they look to the skies,
in search of astral signs, that may lead them to the rediscovery of true greatness.

Knight’s Wig: Adornment prized by the knights of Cainhurst. Resembles a ponytail of silver
hair. The Cainhurst way is a mix of nostalgia and bombast. They take great pride even in the
blood-stained corpses of beasts that they leave behind, confident that they will stand as example
of decadent art.

Knight’s Garb: Attire of the knights of Cainhurst. A regal piece graced by intricate goldwork.

leather. The Cainhurst way is a mix of nostalgia and bombast. They take great pride even in the
blood-stained corpses of beasts that they leave behind, confident that they will stand as examples

Madman Hood: Most tomb prospectors, members of the Healing Church chose to explore the
old labyrinth, are unable to withstand the weight of the old knowledge, and go mad. This attire is
worn by those lost souls. Truth often resembles madness, inaccessible to the dull of mind. Those
who go mad are merely thoughtful souls who failed to reach any conclusions.

Madman Garb: Most tomb prospectors, members of the Healing Church chose to explore the
old labyrinth, are unable to withstand the weight of the old knowledge, and go mad. This attire is
worn by those lost souls. The appendages draped across them are said to be a kind of protective
charm, or at least, that is what these lost souls believe with all their hearts.

Madman Manchettes: Most tomb prospectors, members of the Healing Church chose to
explore the old labyrinth, are unable to withstand the weight of the old knowledge, and go mad.
This attire is worn by those lost souls. Truth often resembles madness, inaccessible to the dull of

Cape Student Uniform: Uniform of the students of Byrgenwerth, a bygone institute of learning.
Features a thick cape. The Healing Church has its roots in Byrgenwerth, and naturally borrows
heavily from its uniform design. The focus not on knowledge, or thought, but on pure pretension
would surely bring Master Willem to despair, if only he knew.

Student Uniform: Uniform of the students of Byrgenwerth, a bygone institute learning. This
alternative lacks the thick cape. This Healing Church has its roots in Byrgenwerth, and naturally
borrows heavily from its uniform design. The focus not on knowledge, or thought, but on pure
pretension would surely bring Master Willem to despair, if only he knew.

Tomb Prospector Set: Attire of tomb prospectors who explore the old labyrinth on behalf of the
Healing Church. The Healing Church traces its roots to Byrgenwerth, and is therefore aware of
the ruins' true importance. They contain much more than mere hunter trinkets, indeed, they hide
the very secrets of the old Great Ones, sought after by those with the insight to imagine
greatness.

Top Hat: Hat worn by hunters who admire formality. Some hunters place an emphasis on form,
as seen by the use of the threaded cane. For them, formality, beauty, and justice are the very
essence of our humanity, and precisely what keeps hunters from becoming something else.

White Church Set: Attire of special Church doctors. These doctors are superiors to the black
preventative hunters, and specialists in experimentally-backed blood ministration and the
scourge of the beast. They believe that medicine is not a means of treatment but rather a method
for research, and that some knowledge can only be obtained by exposing oneself to sickness.

Black Hooded Iron Helm: Iron helmet worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. The hunters of
Yahar'gul answer to the village's founders, the School of Mensis. Hunters in name only, these
kidnappers wear their black hoods low to shadow their eyes. This helm is made of metal, a rarity
for hunter garb, and has high defence, but only against physical attacks.

Iron Yahar’gul Helm: Iron helmet worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. Removing the hood
reveals something reminiscent of a warrior of a previous age. This headwear is made of metal, a
rarity for hunter garb, and has high defense, but only against physical attacks.

Yahar’gul Black Garb: Thick black pullover worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. The
hunters of Yahar'gul answer to the village's founders, the School of Mensis. Hunters in name
only, these kidnappers blend into the night wearing this attire. Designed primarily to defend from
physical attacks, the binding of thick rope serves both to protect its wearer, and restrain his foes.

Yahar’gul Black Gloves: Thick black gloves worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. The
hunters of Yahar'gul answer to the village's founders, the School of Mensis. Hunters in name
only, these kidnappers blend into the night wearing this attire. Designed primarily to defend from
physical attacks.

Yahar’gul Black Trousers: Thick black trousers worn by hunters of the Unseen Village. The
hunters of Yahar'gul answer to the village's founders, the School of Mensis. Hunters in name
only, these kidnappers blend into the night wearing this attire. Designed primarily to defend from
physical attacks.

Yharnam Hunter Set: Ludwig, the first hunter of the Healing Church, once recruited
Yharnamites to serve as hunters. This hunter's attire was made for new recruits, and has excellent
straightforward defense. But not nearly enough to allow an ordinary man to stand any real
chance against the beasts.

Brador’s Testimony: The scalp of a horrid cleric beast, indicating that hunter Brador, a Healing
Church assassin, had killed a compatriot. Afterward, he wore his ally's own scalp, and hid
himself away, deep below in a cell. The Church provided him with a single, soundless bell of
death, to ensure their secrets would be kept.

Beast Hide Garb: The bloodied hide of a horrible cleric beast, pulled over the back. Without the
attacked beast hide this foreigner garb wouldn't raise anyone's eyebrows. Brador donned a
compatriot's beastly scalp and hide while still moist with blood. Most of the blood stains on this
hide were from that day.

Bloodied Arm Bands: Bloodied arm bands. Brador donned a compatriot's beastly scalp and hide
while still moist with blood. Most of the blood stains on this hide were from that day.

Bloodied Trousers: Bloodied foreign trousers. Brador donned a compatriot's beastly scalp and
hid while still moist with blood. Most of the blood stains on this hide were from that day.

Butcher Mask: Mask of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods, likely belonging
to the older of the two. The twins grew up in silent kinship with a poisonous snake. Eventually
they learned human ways, and became hunters. When they discovered vermin even in their
beloved snake, the younger brother is said to have murdered the older.

Butcher Garb: Garb of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods, likely belonging
to the older of the two. Both the twins became hunters, and brought back and dissected their
beast prey, in order to support the villagers in their forbidden research.

Butcher Gloves: Gloves of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods, likely
belonging to the older of the two. Both the twins became hunters, and brought back and dissected
their beast prey, in order to support the villagers in their forbidden research.

belonging to the older of the two. Both the twins became hunters, and brought back and dissected
their beast prey, in order to support the villagers in their forbidden research.

One-eyed Iron Helm: An iron helm resembling an upside-down bucket. A single hole allows
one to peek out with a single eye, which is probably all that its original owner had.

Master’s Iron Helm: An iron helm resembling an upside-down bucket. A single hole allows
one to peek out with a single eye, which is probably all that its original owner had. The iron helm
is passed down among masters of the League. Valtr had in fact lost the ability to see vermin long
ago.

Constable Set: Once upon a time, a troupe of foreign constables chased a beast all the way to
Yharnam, and this is what they wore. The constables became victims of the beast, except for one
survivor, who in turn devoured the creature whole, all by himself. The fable is a favorite among
Yharnamites, who are partial to any stories of pompous, intolerant foreigners who suffer for their
ignorance. It makes the blood taste that much sweeter.

Decorative Old Hunter Set: Old hunter garb decorated with brass trinkets. At the time, some
hunters believed that certain metals would ward off beast blood. On a night of the hunt, it is no
wonder that people would resort to superstition.

Old Hunter Cap: Old Hunter Cap with a wide brim that hides their sharp gaze. In the old days,
when hunters were ten a penny, this was part of their standard garb.

Old Hunter Top Hat: Old hunter top hat, warped by blood stains. In the old days, when hunters
were ten a penny, this was part of their standard garb.

Old Hunter Garb: Old hunter garb. One day, the hunters disappeared, and Yharnamites began
to whisper of the hunters' sin. Drunk with blood, chasing after beasts, they would pass on to the
Nightmare, every last one of them.

Old Hunter Gloves: Old hunter gauntlets made of brass to protect their weapon-bearing hands.
At the time, some hunters believed that certain metals would ward off beast blood. On a night of
the hunt, it is no wonder that people would resort to superstition.

Old Hunter Trousers: Old hunter trousers that protected countless hunters from the beasts in an
older age. A widespread belief of the period was that "beast blood crept up the right leg," and
this led to the double-wrapped belt.

Harrowed Set: Certain Church hunters obfuscate their identities and slip into the nooks and
crannies of the city. This is the garb that allows these harrowed individuals to go unnoticed.
These hunters are keen to early signs of the scourge, serving as a first line of defense against its
outbreak. Or perhaps, when the time is ripe, they find signs of the scourge where there are none.
It just goes to show, the corner beggar is not always who he seems.

Lady Maria’s Set: Among the first hunters, all students of Gehrman, was the lady hunter Maria.
This was her hunter's cap, crafted in Cainhurst. Maria is distantly related to the undead queen,
but had great admiration for Gehrman, unaware of his curious mania.

Yamamura Hunter Hat: A standard hunter's hat, worn by Yamamura the Wanderer. This hat
and staff were given to him when he became a hunter and confederate of the League.

Khaki Haori: Garb of a distant Eastern land, worn by Yamamura the Wanderer. This Eastern
warrior pursued a beast for honourable revenge, then became a hunter of the League. But when
he stared straight into impurity, it drove him mad.

Old Hunter Arm Bands: Old Hunter arm bands wound tightly to prevent infection with the
scourge. Of course, the idea that the scourge was infectious was pure hearsay.

Wine Hakama: Garb of a distant Eastern land, worn by Yamamura the Wanderer. This Eastern
warrior pursued a beast for honourable revenge, then became a hunter of the League. But when
he stared straight into impurity, it drove him mad.

Key Items:
Cainhurst Badge: Badge of the royal guards of Cainhurst, loyal guardians of
the Vileblood Queen Annalise.

The Vilebloods are hunters of blood, and hunt prey as they
search for blood dregs. The hunter who joins them is faced
with a decision: to merely borrow their strength, or to
become one of them, heart and soul.

Cosmic Eye Watcher Badge: Badge of a member of the Choir, elites of the
Healing Church.

The eye signifies the very cosmos.

The Choir stumbled upon an epiphany, very suddenly and
quite by accident. Here we stand, feet planted in the earth,
but might the cosmos be very near us, only just above our
heads?

Crow Hunter Badge: Badge of a hunter of hunters, who hunts those who
have become intoxicated by their bloodlust.

The badge of the hunter of hunters is quitly
passed down from generation to generation,
usually to an outsider from the hinterlands.

To be entrusted with this cursed badge, one must
be strong, resilient to the seduction of blood,
and gracious when taking a comrade's life.

Old Hunter Badge: This hunter's badge, crafted in Gehrman's time, has no
practical purpose, except perhaps to assist in romanticising
about the past.

The badge was a special privilege for the hunters of the past,
and should not be dishonoured.

It should be left in peace, unless one is truly prepared to
assume the will of those gone before.

Powder Keg Hunter Badge: Badge crafted by the Powder Kegs, the heretics of the
Workshop.

The Powder Kegs aboration of complex design and big
booms culminated in weapon designs that contrast with
those traditionally of the Workshop.

The late Powder Kegs, bless their souls, had a motto:
"If a weapon ain't got kick, it just ain't worth it."

Radiant Sword Hunter Badge: One of the badges crafted by the Healing Church.

The radiant sword indicates the heirs to the will of Ludwig.

These hunters, also known as Holy Blades, are what remains
of an ancient line of heroes that date back to a very early
age of honour and chivalry.

Saw Hunter Badge: Badge crafted long ago at the Workshop. Attests to one's
prowess as a hunter of beasts.

The Workshop is gone, and no group recognises this
meaningless badge, except the messengers in the bath, who
understand its profundity.

Certain things can only be entrusted with a hunter in
possession of this badge, or so they believe.

Spark Hunter Badge: Badge crafted in secret by Archibald, the infamous eccentric
of the Healing Church, for his friends.

Archibald was fascinated by the blue sparks that emanate
from the hides of the darkbeasts, and dedicated his life to its
artificial reproduction, in a style of inquiry that, incidentally,
closely followed the methodology of Byrgenwerth.

Sword Hunter Badge: One of the badges crafted by the Healing Church.
The silver sword is a symbol of a Church hunter.

Ludwig was the first of many Healing Church hunters to

come, many of whom were clerics. As it was, clerics
transformed into the most hideous beasts.

Wheel Hunter Badge: Martyr Logarius led a band of Executioners, and this badge
was crafted at their dedicated workshop. The wheel
symbolizes righteous destiny.

Their workshop was a secretive enclave of mystical beliefs
and heady fanaticism which served as the backbone of the
Executioners' unique brand of justice.

Firing Hammer Badge: Badge crafted by the Oto Workshop, precursor to the
workshop of the heretical Powder Kegs.

The Powder Kegs were driven by singular ideas, and crafted
strange weapons of great intricacy.
It is clear that the philosophy of the Powder Kegs was
already established at this time.

Cainhurst Summons: An old blood-stained summons, inviting an honored guest
to the forsaken Castle Cainhurst.

Rather bafflingly, it is addressed to you.

Do not hesitate; the stagecoach leaves from Hemwick crossing.

Hunter Chief Emblem: A cloth emblem that belonged to the captain of the Church
hunters long ago. Opens the main gate that leads to the
round plaza of the Great Cathedral.

The main gate is shut tight on nights of the hunt, and could
only be opened from the other side with this emblem. In
other words, the captain's return, and this
emblem, determined the end of the hunt.

Iron Door Key: Of the three great bridges that link the two cathedral
cradles, this key opens the iron door that leads to the
midlevel bridge.

There are no thieves in the nightmare. Then, why lock a

door? Be warned, there must be a very, very good reason.

Lecture Theatre Key: Key to the Lecture Theatre in the Lecture Building.

Today, the two-story Lecture Building is adrift in the
nightmare, but once it was a place of reflection, where
scholars learned of history and archaeology.

Perhaps it still is, as the students in the lecture theatre
appear to await the return of their professor.

Lunarium Key: Key to the lunarium facing the lake on the second floor of
Byrgenwerth College.

In his final years, Master Willem was fond of the lookout,
and the rocking chair that he kept there for meditation.
In the end, it is said, he left his secret with the lake.

Oedon Tomb Key: Key to the gate that blocks the Tomb of Oedon.

Beyond the tomb, Oedon Chapel can be found in the center
of the Cathedral Ward.

Only today the church is abandoned, and some say that the
residents of Oedon have all gone mad.

Old Hunter Bell: One of the resonating bells that cross the gaps of worlds.
This bell is cracked and stained with the blood of beasts.

A human must expend Insight to ring this uncanny bell.

The old hunters, who have long passed from the dream but
cannot forget the feeling of the hunt, rely upon messengers
to relay their thoughts.
Ring the bell at their side, and they are certain to give a listen.
For the night of the hunt is long, and unchanging.

Orphanage Key: Key to the Orphanage, birthplace of the Choir.

The Orphanage, shadowed by the Grand Cathedral, was a
place of scholarship and experimentation, where young
orphans became potent unseen thinkers for the Healing
Church.

The Choir, that would later split from the Healing Church,
was a creation of the Orphanage.

Queenly Flesh: What remains of Annalise, blood queen of Cainhurst.

This pinkish lump of flesh remains warm, as if cursed.
All hail the undying queen of blood!

Ring of Betrothal: The inhuman beings known as the Great Ones imbued this
ring of betrothal with some special meaning.

In the age of the Great Ones, wedlock was a blood contract,
only permitted to those slated to bear a special child.

Short Ritual Root Chalice: One of the root chalices that breaks various seals in the Old
Labyrinth.

The glass chalice, when full, is used in a short ritual to
quickly create and join a Chalice Dungeon (not for use in a
ritual using standard materials).

Short rituals are conducted at the makeshift altar.

Small Hair Ornament: A small, very ordinary hair ornament.

Although it has been lost for quite some time, one can still
see signs of the care with which this tasteful ornament was
once kept.

Its colour would stand out most brilliantly against a head of
greyish hair.

Tonsil Stone: A latticed, deformed rock, or perhaps a meteorite.

Appears useless, but possesses some old gravitational force
that prevents its riddance. A dubious soul once said:

"Step lightly round to the right of the great cathedral, and
seek an ancient, shrouded church... The gift of the godhead
will grant you strength..."

Unopened Summons: An old, sealed summons.

Like the first of its kind, it is an invitation to Cainhurst, but
for whom is not known, as it lacks addressee.

Upper Cathedral Key: The key to the Upper Cathedral Ward seal.

The upper echelons of the Healing Church are formed by the
School of Mensis, based in the Unseen Village, and the Choir
occupying the Upper Cathedral Ward.

This key brings one a step closer to the Choir.

Yharnam Stone: A sacred heirloom left by Yharnam, Pthumerian Queen.

The Queen lies dead, but her horrific consciousness
is only asleep, and stirs in unsettling motions.

Astral Clocktower Key: Key to the Astral Clocktower at the top of the Grand
Cathedral.

The caretaker of the tower's numerous patients, known to
them only as Lady Maria, made her home behind the giant
star-interpreting clock.

Balcony Key: Key to the balcony on the first floor of the Research Hall.

Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower gave this to the patient,
Adeline.

Maria had hoped Adeline would find comfort in the faint

breeze that carried the scent of flowers from the outside, but
Adeline couldn't fathom her intentions.

First Brain Fluid: Greyish amoeba-shaped brain fluid. Wobbles and bounces.

Extracted from a patient whose head expanded until that
was all that they were.

In the early days of the Healing Church, the Great Ones were
linked to the ocean, and so the cerebral patients would imbibe
water, and listen for the howl of the sea. Brain fluid writhed
inside the head, the initial makings of internal eyes.

Second Brain Fluid: Greyish amoeba-shaped brain fluid. Wobbles and bounces.

Extracted from a patient whose head expanded until that
was all that they were.

Once, a young girl had an older brother who was determined to
become a doctor, and so she wilfully became his patient. In the
end, this led to their encounter with the Eldritch Truth,
for which they considered themselves blessed.

Adeline’s Brain Fluid: Greyish amoeba-shaped brain fluid. Wobbles and bounces.

Extracted from a patient whose head expanded until that
was all that they were.

We fail to realize our own latent potential, until the
moment it is lost, and we sense its absence. Ironically,
this is the very nature of insight, like the moment one
licks one's own blood, only to be startled by its sweetness.

Celestial Dial: A celestial dial that functions with the giant Astral Clock in
the Grand Cathedral.

When the dial is held up towards the Astral Clock, the clock
will come to life, and reveal a secret to its curious interloper.

Eye of a blood-drunk Hunter: The eye of a blood-drunk hunter. Its pupil is collapsed and
turned to mush, indicating the onset of the scourge of beasts.

A hunter who goes drunk with blood is said to be taken by
the Nightmare, destined to wander forever, engaged in an
endless hunt. It is a fate that no hunter can escape.

Eye Pendant: An eye pendant which unlocks the surgery altar.

There are two cathedrals in the Hunter's Dream. One lies
past the River of Blood, and another contains the private
research hall of the Healing Church.

Only chosen members of the Healing Church, or their
lamentable patients, can enter the research hall, using this
eye.

Grant eyes to the surgery altar skull.

Laurence’s Skull: Skull of Laurence, first vicar of the Healing Church.
In reality he became the first cleric beast, and his human
skull only exists within the Nightmare.

The skull is a symbol of Laurence's past, and what he failed
to protect. He is destined to seek his skull, but even if he
found it, it could never restore his memories.

Underground Cell Inner Chamber Key: Key to the inner chamber of the cell below the Grand
Cathedral.

The innermost chamber of the underground cell holds a lone
madman. He wears a beast hide, and rings a bell that emits
no sound.

Unending death awaits those who can hear the soundless
bell.

Underground Cell Key: Key to the cell below the Grand Cathedral.

Hunters are held within the underground cell, so that things

better left unseen, and knowledge better left unknown, will
decay quietly in the fallow darkness.

Blood Gem Workshop Tool: A misplaced workshop tool from the Hunter's Dream.

The hunter who retrieves this can fortify weapons by
kneading blood gems into them.

Blood gems add properties to weapons when used to
fortify them, as blood defines an organism.

Rune Workshop Tool: Runesmith Caryll, student of Byrgenwerth, transcribed the
inhuman utterings of the Great Ones into what are now
called Caryll Runes.

The hunter who retrieves this workshop tool can etch Caryll
Runes into the mind to attain their wondrous strength.

Provost Willem would have been proud of Caryll's runes, as
they do not rely upon blood in any measure.

Workshop Haze Extractor: A misplace workshop tool from the Hunter's Dream.

The hunter who retrieves this can extract Arcane Haze
from ritual materials.

But alas, spent materials are lost.

Black Messenger Hat: Hat that messengers are oddly fond of.
Symbol of the preventative hunters of
the Healing Church.

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an
interest in adornment. Why not let them be happy,
and revel as babes?

Blood Messenger Head Bandage: Accessory adored by naive messengers imitating
the bandages of scourge victims, unaware of their meaning.
The spatters of blood give it a particularly

The inhabitants of the stomp appear to have an
interest in adornment. Why not let them be happy,
and revel as babes?

Messenger Head Bandage: Accessory adored by naїve messengers imitating the
bandages of scourge victims, unaware of their meaning.

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an interest in
adornment. Why not let them be happy, and revel as babes?

A nice top hat rounds out any Yharnam gentleman.

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an interest in
adornment. Why not let them be happy, and revel as babes?

Messenger Urn Festival: Accessory adored by naїve messengers.

The messengers wear the urns, filled with incense that wards
off beasts, on their heads upside-down, suggesting a
predilection to the dark.

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an interest in
adornment. Why not let them be happy, and revel as babes?

Red Messenger Ribbon: Red ribbon that messengers are oddly fond of.

The thick, pungent red was drawn from the organs
of some unfortunate victim.

A strange choice indeed, but perhaps for the messengers
wearing this accessory constitutes a form of mourning.

White Messenger Ribbon: White ribbon that messengers are oddly fond of.

A ribbon made of fine lace that shines remarkably,
more suited to pretty young girls than silly old
messengers.

The inhabitants of the stump appear to have an interest in
adornment. Why not let them be happy, and revel as babes?

Yharnam Messenger Hat: Hat that messengers are oddly fond of.

Commonly called a Yharnam hat.

Consumables:
Antidote: Small medicinal tablets that counteract poison.

Used to treat ashen blood, the baffling sickness that ravaged
Old Yharnam long ago.

These tablets only provide short-term relief. The ashen blood
ailment eventually triggered the spread of the beastly
scourge.

Beast Blood Pellet: Large medicinal pellets, supposedly formed of coagulated
beast blood. Banned by the Healing Church due to
their unclear origin. Grants a spurt of beasthood.

Ripping apart the flesh of one's enemies and being
rained upon by their splattering blood invigorates
one's sense of beasthood, feeding strength and
euphoric feeling alike.

Blood of Adella: Blood taken from Adella, nun of the Healing Church.
Restores an amount of HP, then continues to gradually
restore HP for a short time.

The Healing Church nuns are chosen for their merit as
vessels for blood, and groomed as Blood Saints.

The mere chance of being treated with their blood lends
legitimacy to the Healing Church and communion.

Blood of Arianna: Blood taken from Arianna, Cathedral Ward woman of
pleasure. The sweet blood of Arianna restores HP, and
temporarily speeds stamina recovery.

A member of the old Healing Church would know that her
blood is similar to precisely what was once forbidden.

Blood Vial: Special blood used in ministration. Restores HP.

Once a patient has had their blood ministered, a unique but
common treatment in Yharnam, successive infusions recall
the first, and are all the more invigorating for it.

No surprise that most Yharnamites are heavy users of blood.

Great One’s Wisdom: Fragments of the lost wisdom of the Great Ones, beings that
might be described as gods.

Use to gain Insight.

At Byrgenwerth, Master Willem had an epiphany:
"We are thinking on the basest of planes. What we need, are
more eyes."

Iosefka’s Blood Vial: Blood vial acquired from Iosefka's clinic.

This refined blood, highly invigorating,
restores a larger amount of HP.

The product of a slow and careful refinement process,
this rare blood vial appears to be a clinic original.

Madman’s Knowledge: Skull of a madman touched by the wisdom of
the Great Ones.

Use to gain Insight.
Making contact with eldritch wisdom is a blessing,


        ________________________________________________________________________

for even if it drives one mad,
it allows one to serve a grander purpose, for posterity.

Sedatives: Liquid medicine concocted at Byrgenwerth.
Calms the nerves.

Those who delve into the arcane fall all-too-easily
to madness, and thick human blood serves to calm
the frayed nerves of these inquisitive minds. Naturally,
this often leads to a reliance on blood ministration.

Workshop Third Umbilical Cord: A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every
infant Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.

Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate. The Third Umbilical Cord
precipitated the encounter with the pale moon, which beckoned the hunters and conceived the
hunter's dream.

Use to gain Insight and, so they say, eyes on the inside, although no one remembers what that
truly entails.

Arianna’s Third Umbilical Cord: A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every
infant Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.

Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate, and Oedon, the formless Great
One, is no different. To think, it was corrupted blood that began this eldritch liaison.

Use to gain Insight and, so they say, eyes on the inside, although no one remembers what that
truly entails.

“Iosefka’s” Third Umbilical Cord: A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every
infant Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.

Provost Willem sought the Cord in order to elevate his being and thoughts to those of a Great
One, by lining his brain with eyes. The only choice, he knew, if man were to ever match Their
greatness.

Mergo’s Third Umbilical Cord: A great relic, also known as the Cord of the Eye. Every infant
Great One has this precursor to the umbilical cord.

Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate. This Cord granted Mensis
audience with Mergo, but resulted in the stillbirth of their brains.

Use to gain Insight and, so they say, eyes on the inside, although no one remembers what that
truly entails.

Blood of Adeline: Blood taken from Adeline, patient of the research hall.
Restores HP, and continues to rejuvenate HP for some time.

Adeline was originally one of the Blood Saints who received
treatment by the Church to cultivate worthy blood. Adeline's
was one of the few cases that turned out favorably.

Lead Elixir: A heavy, syrupy liquid medicine.
Temporarily shifts weight to make deflection of attacks
easier, but must be used with care, as it also slows
movement with no change to defense.

Its recipe for this mysterious concoction is unknown, but
some postulate that it materializes only within the most
desperate nightmares.

Blue Elixir: Dubious liquid medicine used in strange experiments
conducted by high ministers of the Healing Church.

A type of anesthetic that numbs the brain.

Hunters, able to retain consciousness by force of will, make
use of a secondary effect of the medicine, which dilutes their
presence while standing still.

Bold Hunter’s Mark: Dubious liquid medicine used in strange experiments
conducted by high ministers of the Healing Church.

A type of anesthetic that numbs the brain.

Hunters, able to retain consciousness by force of will, make

use of a secondary effect of the medicine, which dilutes their
presence while standing still.

Hunter’s Mark: Dangling, upside-down rune etched in one's mind.
Symbol of a hunter.

By focusing one's thoughts on this rune, a hunter
loses all Blood Echoes, but awakens afresh,
as if it were all just a bad dream.


Weapon Buffs:
Bolt Paper: Coarse paper that applies bolt to weapons when rubbed.

Invented by Archibald, the infamous eccentric of the Healing
Church workshop. Artificially recreates the blue sparks that
are said to surround darkbeasts.

Unlike the other strange weapons created by Archibald, this
one was favored by many hunters, in particular those who
had even once laid eyes on a darkbeast.

Bone Marrow Ash: Additional medium that strengthens Quicksilver Bullets.

According to the workshop, this is a special bone marrow
ash collected from Hemwick Charnel Lane.

Invaluable to hunters with weak bloodtinge who require the use of stronger firearms.

Fire Paper: Coarse paper that applies fire to weapons when rubbed.

A hunter tool found in the Healing Church workshop.

Since the tragedy that struck Old Yharnam, fire has become
a staple in beast hunts, and is thought to cleanse impurity.

Certain types of beasts have an abnormal fear of flame.

Throwable Items:
Molotov Cocktail: Explodes in raging flames when thrown against an object.
One of the oldest hunter tools available in the workshop.

Since the tragedy that struck Old Yharnam, fire has become
a staple in beast hunts, and is thought to cleanse impurity.

Certain types of beasts have an abnormal fear of flame.

Oil Urn: When this urn hits its mark, the target is drenched in oil, and
made extremely flammable.

Fire is commonplace on the hunt, and oil urns accentuate its
effect. Sometimes, when hunters burn beasts, they appear
intoxicated by the euphoria of purification.

Pebbles: Small Pebbles found throughout Yharnam.

Can be thrown at foes.

Quite thrilling.

Poison Knife: A knife slathered in poison.

This curved knife is as thin and sharp as a surgeon's blade.
Often used for self-defence by special doctors in the Healing
Church.

They say that hunters traditionally avoid the use of poison,
likely because the poison is too slow to act in the heat of the hunt.

Quicksilver Bullets: Special bullets used with hunter firearms.

Ordinary bullets have no effect on beasts,
and so Quicksilver Bullets, fused with the wielder's
own blood, must be employed.

The strength of Quicksilver Bullets depends greatly
upon wielder's bloodtinge.

Rope Molotov Cocktail: Exploding molotov cocktail that is thrown behind.

Allows for more maneuvering compared to an ordinary
Molotov cocktail, and can catch foes off guard.

Since the tragedy that struck Old Yharnam, fire has become
a staple in beast hunts, and is thought to cleanse impurity.

Certain types of beasts have an abnormal fear of flame.

Shaman Bone Blade: A blade of bone coated with gruesome spinal fluid.
Used by old labyrinth watchers, in particular, those presiding
over rituals.

When victim is cut by this blade, the green spinal fluid
temporarily numbs the senses, disturbing the target's gross
motor skills. The blade, never intended for battle, must cut
deep to be effective, and breaks.

Throwing Knife: Throwing knife with a finely serrated blade.

One of the old hunter Henryk's favorite weapons.

Does not cause a great deal of damage to beasts, but with
deft use, can distract attackers and keep them at bay.

Delayed Molotov: A special hunter tool crafted by the old Oto Workshop.
These molotovs wedge into the ground when thrown, and
explode on a timed delay.

A shame that such a complex gadget must be sacrificed with
each use of this inefficient hunter tool. Nevertheless, delayed
molotovs are cherished by the minority of hunters who
prefer the tricksier kill. This creation is one of the earliest-
known roots of the Powder Kegs.

molotovs are cherished by the minority of hunters who

known roots of the Powder Kegs.

Pungent Blood Cocktail: Mature blood cocktail that releases a pungent odor when
thrown that attracts blood-thirsty beasts.

A precious tool in sadly short supply.

In Yharnam, they produce more blood than alcohol, as the
former is the more intoxicating.

Numbing Mist: Throw to create a mist cloud that numbs a hunter's life
essence and prevents restoration of HP.

Said to be used by the blood hunters of Cainhurst, its recipe
is a secret closely guarded by the line of nobles inhabiting
the castle.


Misc:
Blood Dreg: The Vilebloods of Cainhurst, blood-lusting hunters,
see these frightful things in coldblood.

They often appear in the blood of echo fiends, that is to say,
the blood of hunters. Queen Annalise partakes in these blood
dregs offerings, so that she may one day bear the Child of
Blood, the next Vileblood heir.

Gold Pendant: Pendant of Vicar Amelia. Use to change into a Blood Gem,
which fortifies weapons.

This pendant, passed down among the vicars who head the Healing Church,
is a reminder of the cautionary adage. To reveal the adage,
touch the altar skull.

Hand Lantern: Small portable lantern.

This hunting accessory provides light while leaving
both hands free to hold weapons. The torch, however, provides a stronger source of light.

Monocular: Monocular used to View things up close.

Not a hunter's tool, but a simple antique, to be used as one sees fit.

Red Jeweled Brooch: A woman's bright-red brooch, engraved with the name Viola.

Perhaps the jewel is a gift from a hunter. Use to change into
a droplet blood gem that fortifies any weapon.

With the proper workshop tool, various weapons can be
fortified.

Shining Coins: Various coins that are particularly luminous.

There are very few uses for spare change during the hunt,
but these will serve as guides through the darkness.

Or, one could save them until morning, if it ever comes.

Tear Stone: Silver-shining tear stone.

Use to change into a droplet blood gem that fortifies any
weapon.

A doll sheds neither blood nor tears, and thus its nature
remains unknown.

Tiny Music Box: A small music box received from a young Yharnam girl.
Plays a song shared by her mother and father.

Inside the lid is a small scrap of paper, perhaps an old
message. Two names can be made out, however faintly.

Viola and Gascoigne.

Vermin: A centipede-like creature discovered on successful hunts by
League hunters.

Vermin, found hidden within filth, are only seen by League
confederates, and are the root of man's impurity. The League
has assumed the task of finding and crushing all vermin.

Perhaps there is some mercy in the madness. Those who
wish to see vermin can, and those who choose to are
provided with boundless purpose.


Coldblood:
Coldblood Dew: Droplet of coldblood containing Blood Echoes.

Use to gain Blood Echoes.

Hunters sustained by the dream gain strength from Blood
Echoes. They imbibe the blood with thoughts of reverence,
indeed gratitude, for their victims.

Thick Coldblood: A thick droplet of coldblood containing Blood Echoes.

Use to gain a larger amount of Blood Echoes.

A strong will produces thick blood. Doubtless, the product of
obsession, a potent source of human strength.

Frenzied Coldblood: A rich droplet of coldblood containing Blood Echoes.

Use to gain frenzied Blood Echoes.

This manifestation of madness comes from a mind teetering
on the very brink, but has a sane mind ever produced
anything of true significance?

Kin Coldblood: Coldblood of inhuman kin of the cosmos, brethren of the
Great Ones.

Use to gain unspeakable Blood Echoes.

Dare not to delve into the world beyond humanity, the

Arcane/Bloodtinge Tools:
A Call Beyond: One of the secrets of the Choir.

Long ago, the Healing Church used phantasms to reach a
lofty plane of darkness, but failed to make contact with the
outer reaches of the cosmos.

The rite failed to achieve its intended purpose, but instead
created a small exploding star, now a powerful part of the
Choir's arsenal.
At times, failure is the mother of invention.

Augur of Ebrietas: One of the secret rites of the Choir,
high-ranking members of the Healing Church.

           ________________________________________________________________________
                                                                                    Script 81



Use spirits, the invertebrates known to be augurs of
the Great Ones, to partially summon abandoned Ebrietas.

One of the few rites that allow one to directly utilize
the power of the Great Ones, and evidence that
the Choir had approached the eldritch Truth.

Beast Roar: One of the forbidden hunter tools
made by Irreverent Izzy.

Borrow the strength of the terrible undead darkbeasts,
if only for a moment, to blast surrounding foes back with
the force of a roaring beast.

The indescribable sound is broadcast with the caster's
own vocal cords, which begs the question, what terrible
things lurk deep within the frames of men?

Empty Phantasm Shell: Empty invertebrate shell that is said to be a familiar of a
Great One. The Healing Church has discovered a great
variety of invertebrates, or phantasms, as they are called.

Shells with slime still harbour arcane power, and can be
rubbed on weapons to imbue them with their strength.

Executioner's Gloves: One of the secret treasures hidden in Cainhurst.
The gloves of an executioner from a faraway land.

Passed from executioner father to executioner son,
these gloves can be used to summon wrathful spirits
of the past by smearing them with blood.

It is said that the nobles found in immeasurable delight
in the dances of these vengeful specters.

Choir Bell: Special hunter tool of the Choir, high-ranking
member of the church. Fashioned after a bell that
projects an arcane sound across planes of existence.



        ________________________________________________________________________
                                                                                   Script 82


The sound of this smaller, silver version of the bell
does not cross planes, but grants vigor and healing
to all cooperators.

Messenger’s Gift: A strange gift from the messengers, inhabitants of
the dream who revere the brave hunters.

Use to envelop oneself in a black nightmarish mist,
then transform into a messenger. The illusion is a parlor
trick, and any large movement will break the spell.

To preserve the guise, proceed very slowly.

Old Hunter Bone:
The bone of an old hunter whose name is lost.

It is said that he was an apprentice to old Gehrman, and a
practitioner of the art of Quickening, a technique particular
to the first hunters.

It is most appropriate that hunters, carriers of the torch who
are sustained by the dream, would tease an old art from his
remains.

Tiny Tonitrus: Tonitrus is a unique weapon crafted by Archibald,
the infamous eccentric of the Healing Church workshop.

This is a similar morning star mace that utilizes
Quicksilver Bullets. When struck into the ground,
it recreates the blue sparks that are said to surround
the darkbeasts.

Like Archibald's masterpiece, this too
is a superb conductor of the powerful blue sparks.

Accursed Brew: Skull of a local from the violated fishing village. The inside
of the skull was forcibly searched for eyes, as evidenced by
innumerable scratches and indentations.

No wonder the skull became stewed in curses.

They who offer baneful chants.
Weep with them, as one in trance.

Blacksky Eye: Soft eye blessed by a phantasm. They were
discovered through Byrgenwerth's contact with the
arcane, but in the end revealed nothing.

Deep within the eye lies a vast stretch of dark
sky that rumbles with an endless meteor storm.
The slightest rub of the tiny orb, and the rock
will tumble and soar.

Madara’s Whistle: Whistle of the Madaras twins, denizens of the Forbidden Woods.
The twins grew up alongside a poisonous snake, and
developed a silent, inhuman kinship.

The poisonous snake grew uncontrollably, raised on a
healthy diet of beast entrails. Even after their deaths, it is
said to respond to the call of the twins' whistle from within the Nightmare.


Online Items:
Beckoning Bell: Great Old Bell discovered in the underground labyrinth.

Its ring resonates across worlds, and the first hunter used it
as a special signal to call hunters from other worlds to cross
the gap and cooperate.

A human must use Insight to ring this uncanny bell, but the
benefits of cross-world cooperation are many.

Note: Online use only. Cannot use this item offline.

League Staff: The League staff is the sign of a confederate.
A directory within the hilt lists the names of fellow

There shall be no sympathy for those engaged in the bloody
mission of the League. No matter that an oath must be taken
to uphold the illusion.

Notebook: Messengers are inhabitants of the dream who revere the
brave hunters. Use them to send messages to other worlds.

Leave notes with messengers, read the notes left by
messengers in other worlds, and rate notes to participate
in the formation of a shared inter-plane intelligence.

Silencing Blank: Hunters are linked by the resonance of bells with special
encoded timbres. This inaudible burst disrupts such
resonance.

Fire to end co-operation, and prevent further co-operation.
Firing this does not disrupt the resonance of a sinister bell.

Note: Online use only. Cannot use this item offline.

Sinister Resonant Bell: A blood-stained bell discovered in the old underground
labyrinth.

One of the resonating bells that cross the gaps of worlds, but
this one knells for misfortune and malice.

The Sinister Bell is an object of dark thoughts. Ring it to
become the enemy of a hunter in another world.

Caryll Runes:
Beast Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

A transcription of the roar of a labyrinth beast, the bearer of
the "Beast" rune has accentuated transformation effects.

"Beast" is one of the early Caryll Runes, as well as one of the
first to be deemed forbidden. The discovery of blood entailed
the discovery of undesirable beasts.

Blood Rapture Rune: A Caryll rune that transcribes inhuman sounds.
"Blood Rapture" is the raw euphoria of the warmth of blood.
Restores HP with visceral attacks, one of the darker hunter
techniques.

This rune resonates with servants of the Queen, carrier of
the Child of Blood, who yearn for their Queen's blood with
little hope of requitement.

For them, they find solace in "Blood Rapture," that serves as
a surrogate for their desires.

Clawmark Rune: A Caryll rune that transcribes inhuman sounds.

The "Clawmark" is an impulse to seek the warmth of blood
like a beast. It strengthens visceral attacks, one of the darker
hunter techniques.

Although the difference is subtle, Runesmith Caryll describes
the "Beast" as a horrific and unwelcome instinct deep within
the hearts of men, while "Clawmark" is an alluring invitation
to accept this very nature.

Communion Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

Several runes relate to "blood," including "Communion,"
which raises the maximum number of blood vials
one may carry.

ministers. Blood ministration is, of course, the pursuit
of communion.

Eye Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

A transcription of "eye," as spoken by left-behind Great
Ones. Allows one to make additional discoveries.

Eyes symbolize the truth Master Willem sought in his
research. Disillusioned by the limits of human intellect,
Master Willem looked to beings from higher planes for
guidance, and sought to line his brain with eyes in order to
elevate his thoughts.

Formless Oedon Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

The Great One Oedon, lacking form, exists only in voice,
and is symbolised by this rune. Those who memorise it enjoy
a larger supply of Quicksilver Bullets.

Human or no, the oozing blood is a medium of the highest
grade, and the essence of the formless Great One, Oedon.
Both Oedon, and his inadvertent worshippers, surreptitiously
seek the precious blood.

Heir Rune: A Caryll rune that transcribes inhuman sounds.

The "Heir" sees sentimentality in the warmth of blood, and
acknowledges visceral attacks as one of the darker hunter
techniques.

More blood echoes gained from visceral attacks.

Perhaps the "Heir" is a hunter who bears the echoing will of
those before him.

Moon Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

inhabiting the nightmare.

The Great Ones that inhabit the nightmare are
sympathetic in spirit, and often answer when called upon.

Oedon Writhe Rune: A Caryll rune that transcribes inhuman sounds.

"Writhe" sees a subtle mucous in the warmth of blood,
and acknowledges visceral attacks as one of the darker hunter
techniques. Visceral attacks restore Quicksilver Bullets.

grade, and the essence of the formless Great One, Oedon.
Both Oedon, and Oedon's inadvertent worshippers,

Guidance Rune: A Caryll rune discovered by the old hunter Ludwig along
with the Holy Moonlight Sword.
Boosts amount of life recovered by rallying.

When Ludwig closed his eyes, he saw darkness, or perhaps
nothingness, and that is where he discovered the tiny beings
of light. Ludwig was certain that these playful dancing
sprites offered "guidance," and emptied Ludwig of his fears
at least in the midst of a hunt.

Lake Runes: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

This transcription of the Great Ones' inhuman voices
ripples like a watery reflection. This rune means "Lake,"
and those branded by it enjoy augmented defense.

Corruption Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

Several runes contain a nuance of "Blood," including the
rune of "Corruption," associated with the oath of the corrupt.

Pledgers to this oath are Cainhurst Vilebloods, hunters of
blood who find dregs for their Queen in coldblood,
particularly in that of hunters.


        ________________________________________________________________________

thus subject to the wrath of the Executioners.

adopted by those who have taken the Hunter of Hunters oath.

threatened the pledgers of the "Hunter" oath surely has an
issue with blood.

to symbolize "Impurity," and the oath of the League.

Confederates of The League cooperate with hunters from
other worlds, and hunt to discover vermin.

impurity. Crush all vermin without hesitation.

Radiance Rune: A secret symbol left by Caryll, runesmith of Byrgenwerth.

The rune for "Radiance," adopted by the sworn
Executioners under Logarius' command.

The executioners despise the impure Vilebloods,
and no matter what the circumstances, would
never cooperate with the bloodthirsty hunters
who serve the undead queen, Annalise.

Beast’s Embrace Rune: After repeated experiments in controlling the scourge of
beasts, the gentle "Embrace" rune was discovered.

When its implementation failed, the "Embrace" became a
forbidden rune, but its knowledge became a foundation of
the Healing Church.

Those who swear this oath take on a ghastly form, and enjoy
accentuated transformation effects, especially while wielding a beast weapon.

Oh, are you all right, brave hunter? I will never leave your side…

Alfred, Hunter of Vilebloods: Long ago, Old Yharnam was overrun by the plague of beasts,
and left to rot and decay. It was blocked off for good, and now the only voices heard there are the
howls of beasts. One of the Holy Chalices that unlocks the tomb of the gods is said to be there.
The church is determined to obtain this Old Yharnam chalice... But we've yet to hear word of
any success. Perhaps they're facing some difficulties?

But, why... Oh, a mercy killing! So must I pass on in my prime... Yes, of course... So thoughtful,
as always... Pray for Master Logarius in my stead..

You'll... regret this... I had hopes for you...

You damned fool... You let the blood get the best of you... Heh heh heh...

Here I am! At your service!

Ahh, glad you made it!

Terrific! Good hunting! To the both of us. Good hunting! To the both of us.

I'm bloody glad you told 'im about us. Stop! Please! What's the- Why! Please, good hunter! I'm
beggin' ya stop... Please, just stop... Please, good hunter! How did it come... to this... Kind...
hunter... l just wanted to help... people... I only wanted... to be... your friend... But you didn't
want to be mine... did ya... Kind... hunter... But you didn't want to be mine... did ya…

Djura, Retired Hunter: I'm afraid this is the best an old hunter can do... But remember one
thing. You're not hunting beasts. You're hunting people...

Heheh, you devious rat! The makings of a true hunter, this fellow/lass! Very well. Then there's
no need to hold back! The beasts will feast tonight!

You still dream, I should think? Then come as often as you like, and I will show you another
death. Even a beast will feel pain, eventually…

Don't you understand? All beasts were once men. Where is the profit in their murder? Why?
Why insist on hunting us? We will never leave Old Yharnam. What possible harm could we
cause? Whatever feeds your bloodlust… ...is of your own creation, not ours!

Plain Doll*: Oh, good hunter, I must have displeased you... Go on, shut me down... Even so, this
vessel will remain in your service... So, have no fear... I must have displeased you…
*She has also cut humming of a Russian lullaby, the same lullaby that the Winter Lanterns sing.


Eileen the Crow: You ignored my warning... You killed Henryk... And made it back alive. Not
bad at all. You must've killed Gascoigne as well, then? They were falling apart... I'm sure it had
to be done. But try to keep your hands clean. A hunter should hunt beasts. Leave the hunting of
hunters to me…

Intoxicated by the hunt, drenched in the blood of beasts... What a sorry state you're in. I will be
merciful, on my hunter's honor...

You can't go on like this... I pity you. A hunter gone mad for the hunt...

You still have dreams? Then take a rest, and get your feet back on the ground… ...Tell the little
doll I said hello...

...Ahh... you monsters... All hunters must die! The hunt makes hunters mad... Look at you, you're
no different…

Fishing Hamlet Priest: Kos! Fair child of Kos! Time is not, and the sea rumbles afar. And yet, a
mother's pungent devotion can still be felt.

Ahh, thank you, messenger, I exude gratitude for one such as you. Kos, bless this messenger, this
visitor from beyond.

Father Gascoigne: ...WeII, well. A hunter is it? Ahh, tonight, there's something different in the
air... Men leave as hunters, and return as beasts. ...Let there be no doubt. If it moves, you can be
sure it's a beast. ...And even if it doesn't, well, don't take any chances! Ha ha ha ha ha hah!

...Well, well. A hunter is it? Beasts everywhere... I like the smell of this hunt already! Ha ha haa!

...Oooh, beasts and beasts and beasts and beasts...

...Ahh, the sweet stench of blood. Just... just marvelous!

That stench of squalid blood. No beast will be spared.

The reek of blood. That intolerable scent. It sickens me.

Sick creature, may you rest in peace. Umbasa.

Gascoigne’s Younger Daughter: Are you that Hunter?

Gatekeeper: What's the password?

Ahh, my first visitor in two decades. I suppose it's just that kind of a night.

Ahh, my first visitor in two decades. Well go on, then, buzz off! The hunt is on tonight. No need
to throw yourself to the wolves. Now, be gone!

I don't know how a hunter learned the password, but let me say this much... Down the
embankment, beyond the forest, there it stands, old Byrgenwerth. But it's not what you think.
They don't welcome newcomers, and their knowledge is better left untouched. No, the old
college is not what it once was. Those who enter, never return. At least, not as who they were
upon entering. ...Don't say you weren't warned...

I don't know how a hunter learned the password, but let me say this much... I cannot stop anyone
who knows the password. I can only warn them. So, go on, visitor.
For that's what the master wishes of you. Sometimes, master's whims are most mystifying...

So, go on, visitor. For that's what the master wishes of you. I cannot stop anyone who knows the
password. You are free to go.

...Ahh, ahh, ahh, a nightmare is upon us... ls this your doing, great master? Does it mean that my
work is done? Ahh, ahh... Ohhhhhhh... Pass... word... The password... Say... the password... Say
it, now.

...password... Got to close the... Ahh, ahh, ohhhhh.... I... I have failed... Forgive me... forgive me,
Master Willem...

Ah, my first visitor in a year!

Ah, my first visitor in a decade!

Ah, my first visitor in, ooh, half a century!

Gehrman, the First Hunter: ...lt has been a long dream, a very long dream... Since I can no
longer hunt, this is all I can do... I made a promise, to a dear friend... A promise...

Good, good. You're back, and it will all be over soon, then. The moon is close. How fitting, on
this night to end all nights.

...Laurence, I'm getting old. I'm of little help, and to wake is to die... But I'm not entirely
useless... I can still do my share. How long I've waited. For this chance to do something.


Fire, cast upon the workshop?

Well, my good hunter. The night is long, the darkness thick. Don't say you weren't warned...
Yharnam... how easily she forgets, how quickly she dismisses.

Time is a cruel, cruel thing. Haven't you noticed?

What, looking to free me? Then I graciously accept. Forgive me, Laurence, I could not wait...
The night, and the dream, were long...

You must accept your death. Forget the dream, wake up to the morning. Be freed from the
night...

What were you thinking? If I die, you are to be next... What is it you want, from this horrific
nightmare?

Night will soon come again.

What's taking so long, Laurence... Yes, the hunt must go on. It is all that keeps us human, now.
Farewell, Laurence. I await the realization of your "ministration."

How magnificently the flame burns.

Hunters are held here to be sent on horrific hunts, their souls rotted by blood and madness.

We've no need for this accursed abode. Let flame cleanse this house of horrors.

All these frightful things! Look at them burn!

Oh, ye Hunters, let it be known! We are free, free as the wind!

Laurence, the end is not far away, now.

Every last dream will burn out, and Flora will return from the moon.

As for us, the time has come to honour our vows.

Hunters are needed no longer.

You and I shall fight to the death, and she will consume the victor.

The way we've always said we'd end it, you recall.

Oh, Laurence. Of course you remember.

Laurence: So, you're intent on hunting beasts? Even if they are men? But why must you...
Indeed, Gehrman. It won't be long...

So, you're intent on hunting beasts? Even if... they are... But, Gehrman... Why must you...
Indeed. It won't be long...

I must take my leave, Master Willem…

Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower: Hmm... a visitor. How unexpected. Then the secrets of
the Church have been laid bare.

Good hunter, lost in a nightmare, what did you think of that beastly legend and those ailing
wards of the Church? I know what you did to them. It's not your fault. The nightmare held them,
and now they are free. But what about you? Have you profited at all?

Oh, really? Well, that's a relief. Now you can leave this nightmare. Have respect for the beast
hunter Gehrman's wishes. Besides, you will not find your enemies here. Take the relics in this
room as your parting prize. Let them be your strength, and return to your hunt, good Hunter.
I thought as much. Nightmares and secrets, they'll only get you so far. Now you can leave this
place.

What's wrong, my Hunter? Don't you hear the Hunt calling? Or do you wish to tease something
more from the depths of this nightmare, even if it means my murder?

Hmm... look at you. That glint in your eyes. You, boy/girl, are insufferable. Oh, I know very well,
how the secrets beckon so sweetly. Only an honest death will cure you now. Liberate you, from
your wild curiosity.

Micolash, Host of the Nightmare: Ah-hah, welcome to our dream. But we don't need anyone,
not any more! The sacred rite nears completion. The dream will be real! We will be granted
eyes! Catch us if you can, in this dream of dreams!

Well, come on! Ah-hah, welcome to our dream. Ah hah hah ha!

Please, somebody, anybody, somebody look into my eyes.

I hear prayers.

I can't sleep, not ever. So sit here, very, very quietly. A sort of sleepless sleep.
Ah, Kosm, or some say Kos.

Rom, the downside-up fool.

Great cosmos, of course.

I need more eyes to line the wrinkles of my brain.

The brain is all we have.

Please, somebody, anybody, my eyes, my sweet dreams.

Let us sit about and speak feverishly. Chatting into the wee hours... of my wonderful nightmare!

Oh, you kindred spirit, look into my eyes. No, no, look harder.

Oh, you are terrible.

There's nothing to be ashamed of! We were friends! How could you?

Look into my eyes. Deep into my eyes.

Narrow-Minded Man: You... you're not from around here are ya? An outsider who's come to
join the hunt? What a pathetic idea. You what? What, you think I'm a beast? Well, maybe I think
you're a beast. You probably think every old man is some ghoul or villain! Well, away with ya!
And step away from my castle!

I heard you told the old hag about some shelter. Well, any sweet-talking stranger could fool an
old hag. Me? I wouldn't touch ‘er with a ten foot bargepole.

I heard you told the old hag about some shelter. Well, any sweet-talking stranger could fool an

Oh, enough. Enough please. Look, I'm short on blood, and you're a real headache. I've no time
for your petty lies.

Oh, don't you ever... No, y'know what, wait a minute. l'm in a generous mood. Give me blood, as
much as you can. And I'll forgive your lies and deceit. This is your last chance, outsider, to
redeem yourself.

Heheh... yeah, as it should be. Outsiders wilI always be outsiders. What salvation could possibly
await them here?

Heheh, as it should be. Outsiders will always be outsiders. I mean, what salvation could possibly
await them here?

I'll spare you one nugget of advice. Beware the old hag. I saw her slipping away in the night. No
one in their right mind would do that, not on a night like this. So, you see... that can only mean
one thing...

I mean... what salvation could possibly await them here?

How dare ya. An outsider won't get far behaving like that.

Bloody offcomer... curse you... Why me, eh…

Kind Old Dear: What is it? I smell that... You must be a hunter. And not one of ours, either.
Well, get lost, and don't come back! I wouldn't open my door for me own poor mother, not on a
night of the hunt! And certainly not for a rotten offcomer. Go on, away with ya!

What's a hunter, anyway? Go feed yourself to a beast.

Get lost, enough of this! Oh, help me, gods...

Ahh, how di' we get into this rotten spot... My little sweet pea. You just need more blood, that's
all... But the doctor's not in... What's a mother to do?

But the doctor's not in... Oh, my goodness... You just need a little more blood, is aII... Oh, look
who's come, dear. The doctor's in! Ahh, fine, fresh blood. Everything'lI be better now... Yeah,

Patches: Well, well! Perchance... a shortcut, here? Thank me not, your countenance speaks

What troubles you, dear companion? Are you in need of my assistance?

What troubles you, dear companion? Are you lacking, or just lost? Are you lacking, or just lost?

Unused Yharnamite: Not from around here, are ya? And outside, on a night of the hunt? You
must be sick, mate. Black death upon you. I hope they have your head before morning, now be
gone. Get away from me right now, go.

Mate, not you again. We're not like you. Don't you understand that, we're still normal, you
see. ...But, I'll tell you what though, if you want to insist on asking me questions. Bring us blood.
That's right, blood. Then, I'll tell you what I know. It hardly pays to be choosy these days.

As it's written in the good book, mate. "No blood is bad blood!" Hee hee hee! ...But, I'll tell you
what though, if you want to insist on asking me questions.

Oh, you. Did you bring us blood? Did you bring us blood? Oh, ah, very good. Yeah, nice one
mate. Yeah, very good. So, what do you want to know?

The blood of a sage? Hmm, I don't know nothing. Not a thing. It's some made-up nonsense, or...
you know what... wait a minute, wait a minute... The minister at the cathedral might know
something. Father Norbert's his name, quite an highbrow, you see but... Well, the only trouble
is... On the nights of the hunt, the Western Quarter is boarded up, blocking passage to the
cathedral in the Eastern Quarter. And once the hunt is done, well... well, you'll be dead, along
with all the other sickos, you see. Hee hee hee!

The minds of the infected are frail. Perhaps you deserve mercy. I know nothing, but Father
Norbert, head of the cathedral in the Eastern Quarter, might know something. Pay him a visit, if
you dare! Hee hee hee, be gone.

Laurence? Ah yes Laurence, another outsider, like yourself? Yeah, I know him. He Ieft for the
cathedral in the Eastern Quarter. On my advice, even. Unlucky for him. You see, just after he
left, the bell tolled, kicking off the hunt. And no offcomer ever lives through the hunt, trust me
mate. Hee hee hee! Hee... hic!

Poor thing. Oh, what to do? With all these hunts, we’ve run out of food. Oh, I
know. Here, try this. It’s full of nutrition and should fill you up. You might not fancy
it, but it’s all I’ve got.

Really? Well, this is all I’ve got. Hope you don’t mind.

Every so often, we’re struck by a malady. The scourge of lycanthropy. When it
spreads, they signal the Hunt. But don’t worry, they know exactly what they’re
doing. You let the Hunters handle it, like always. This time, it’s just a bit worse
than usual, that’s all. It’ll all be over soon enough, dear.

You needn’t concern yourself with that. The Hunters will take care of it. Tonight’s
Hunt will be the last, I’m sure of it.

What on Earth is that? I really don’t know. Perhaps you should ask someone else.
I’m sorry to be of so little help.

Oh, Laurence. Friend of yours, is he? Dear me, I should have known. He left to
find a doctor to treat you, but the Hunt started soon after, and that was a full two
weeks ago. Wonder where he’s taken cover? He’ll be back once the Hunts are
over. He’ll be wonderfully pleased to find you awake. He was very, very concerned
about you.

Now, you be very, very careful, you hear? You’ve been given a second chance.
Don’t waste it.

Aah… you’ve been infected.

My name's Izzy. Master Hunter, if it's not too much trouble, may we...may we talk here for a
while? I'm no genius, I know, but I can still be of help.

Thank you so much. It's an honour to talk with you. I'll do anything I can to help, master Hunter.

Master Hunter, do you wish to talk about the Holy Chalices? Underground, lies the Tomb of the
Gods. Only a Holy Chalice can break the seal. It's a Yharnam legend, the city's secret. One of the

Holy Chalices is enshrined in Old Yharnam. It fell to the scourge, and its charred ruins lie in the
valley. All that's left is a town full of beasts, and not even the Healing Church dare venture there.
But there's nothing you couldn't deal with, Master Hunter.

Master Hunter, you're an outsider, aren't you?

It’s not just how you talk, but the air you give off too. And, well, there aren't many Hunters
around these days.

...That's alright, though...

I was born in Yharnam, but I wanna see the outside world one day!

...At the very least, it won't be in state this place is...

Master Hunter, why is it that you talk to that Doll sometimes?
She doesn't move, but she's so, so beautiful.

So... I've spent a long time watching her myself. Is there any way I can make her talk to me?

Thank you so much. Master Hunter, do you...Do you know the history of the Church Workshop?
The leaders of the Healing Church reside in the upper stratum of Cathedral Ward. Nearby is the
Church's own Workshop. Ludwig was the first Hunter to join the Church, and most of those who
came after followed in his footsteps.

The Church made them a Workshop where they forged their own weapons. Nowadays it's just an
old story...You see, I like the stories of the Hunters… It's the only thing I can really talk about...

The thing we were just talking about? The Church Workshop is in the upper stratum of Cathedral
Ward. I know it's just an old story, but...

Archibald: Who are you? A Hunter, are you? Ah, that's just perfect! My name is Archibald. No
need to be wary. I'm an outsider of a decent sort, like you. I wish to uncover the truth about
Yharnam.

If you're a Hunter, will you be exploring the Underground Labyrinths? If so, bring me back the
Blood of the Gods, Blood Gems. I can use them to make your weapons stronger...

Ah, you're safe. Any news? Found any unusual Blood Gems?

Your face tells me something is amiss. Anything wrong? Have something else to give?

Farewell.

I expect you'll bring me some more rare Blood Gems. You are like a vampire, after all...

Oh my, that Blood Gem you have...Ah, magnificent... isn’t its Aroma intoxicating...? Hurry and
hand it over...

It's unbearable... Well, I understand why Byrgenwerth went mad... Even I seem to be losing
myself...
...

There, it's yours. Isn't it tremendous? Be careful, make sure the blood doesn’t get to you.

Such a..! Why!? Such cruelty!

So it's like this, then... Already half-dead!

Ah, have you reconsidered...?

...Ahh, you've reconsidered?

...I've been waiting for one like you...You have a Blood Gem, yes? I can smell it...Hurry...
Hurry...how delightful, its smell...

When will you be back next? Don't make me wait too long. I need Blood Gems...

That scent of yours...So pungent...I can already taste it…Hurry up, hurry...!

Ah, this is for you. In a short while, very short, Mud will no longer obscure your vision.

...Ahh...Ahh...Ahh, Why...? ...Why do you say such unkind things to me...Ahh... Stop this
unkindness...

...You, why are you...? Damn it all, this is... such cruelty...

...Even from within me...

It smells rather pleasant, doesn't it?

...Have you gone mad...?

...Well, I should have expected as much.

You're not a decent sort like me, are you?

...You've gone mad, haven't you?

Well, me... I'm already an unreasonable sort....

You...You, stop this treachery...Painful, so painful...

Plain Doll(Early Draft): Greetings, Diseased One.
This dream is the nightmare of those afflicted by the disease.

Always on the verge of death, consumed by madness, yet still willing themselves to survive.

That is the nightmare they live through.

You are the same, yes? That is why you wake up when you die.

Like it was all just a nightmare. That is what madness is, after all.

Diseased One.

Seek out madness. I will transform it into your strength.
Whatever it is that your will desires. Please, make use of me.

Welcome home, Diseased One.

Was the awakening eventful?

Farewell, Diseased One. I hope your awakening is pleasant.

I will channel your madness into strength. Stand close, and shut your eyes.

Many have visited this nightmare in the past, then gone to their deaths.

These gravestones are all that remain of them.

It all seems so long ago, now.

The little ones inhabit the nightmare. They adore and follow the Diseased.

I don't understand their language, yet they are still very kind.

Strange things like that make me curious.

Gods love their creations, don't they? I am a doll, made by you humans.

Do you love me?

So, the opposite must be true.

Then, I do love you. It must have been my creator’s wish.

What... What is this? I don't remember anything, I don't know what's happening to me.

But, I feel this nostalgia... Something I’ve never felt before...

Does this all seem strange to you?

Ah...Diseased One, I thank you deeply.

You made me feel some happiness.

Forgive me if I caused you displeasure...Please shut me down.

Even so, this body will remain in service to you.

So please, do not worry.

Micolash(Vicar Micolash, Early Draft): ...Hello, how do you do?
I was the Healing Church's... leader. My name is Micolash. Father Norbert/Herbert was infected,
but you liberated him.

I will thank you in his stead. Umbasa.

Ah, but you are a skilled Hunter.

... and yet ...

No, you need not say it, I understand.

You are trapped by a nightmare and seek the Blood of a Sage.

I'm very sorry, but I cannot help you.

I can tell you only one thing.

Seek out the old college.

Head west from the plaza in front of the Grand Cathedral and through the forest of snakes.

There, you will find an old, abandoned college.

The knowledge you seek will be there.

The Hunt is not over yet. Please be careful...Umbasa...

Someone, anyone, anyone...Please, look into my eyes...I hear bells... I hear prayers...I can't sleep,
I can't sleep, not ever...Silence, silence, then more silence.

I'm always sleeping, I can't stay awake...

Ah, Kos, or some say Kosm.

Rom, the upside-down fool.

Sunk in the mud, we cannot see the waters of the lake. The cosmos!

I think the eyes aren't enough. For me, for my brain...Yes, my brain!
Someone, please...My eyes, my eyes, my dream...

Let us speak feverishly through the night.

Of my wonderful nightmare! Ahh!

I see, just another madman taken by the nightmare after all...
Good, Good that the blood sent you into madness...

Unused Character 1: Come now, bring forth your blood,
so that the Great Lord may see into your thoughts.

Unused Character 2: You... You, you don't happen to know something about this, do you?
Have you seen my head anywhere?
It's been missing for so long. I can't find it anywhere. It's quite troublesome.
Do you know anything?

Aah, that's excellent! Very good. If you know, that's wonderful.
I can't thank you enough. Is there anything I can do for you?
My greatest thanks. You've given me such hope.

Aah, yes... Yes, that's just how it goes.
Even though it's my own head, I can't find it anywhere...
Aah, where could it have gone..? My head...

Unused Character 3: Ahhh! ...My friend? My friend.

Good to see you're safe. What's the matter?

Do you need help with something?

...My friend, take heed and be careful.

Everyone else is against us. They hunger for knowledge.

Knowledge they don't have, knowledge not even we have... the futility of it all frightens me.

A mystery has no value once it's understood... It's all best forgotten...Remember that...

Unused Character 4: Ooh! Ooh!

Do you know of the great cosmos? Do you really know?

Inside of you? Inside of me? Where do you think it is?

Ooh! Ooh! Is that so!?

Let's go inside of you, then!

Ooh! Ooh! Is that so!? Well, come in, then! Inside of me!

Ooh! Ohh...This new philosophy... Should be forgotten...Should be forgotten...

Unused Character 5: ...Hey, do you remember?
I used to be sand, and I couldn't fly to the sky.

I'm still not flying, even now.

...And you. You're like me, when I was sand...

Unused Character 6: Give me your blood.
You want to make me your bride, don't you?

Please, think of your bride.

Unused Character 7: Aah, is that you, my boy?

Where were you? Your mother was so worried.

Everyone wanders off sometimes, I suppose.

Now, do you want something to eat?

Ah, your tummy's already full. That's good, good.

You come back soon...Definitely, soon...

Unused Character 8: ...Aah, it's rotting. Slurp, slop..
...Slurp, slop. The sound of my brain rotting...You, come and help me. My brain is
rotting...Please, you must come...

...You are kind...

...What are you???

It's softening... Slurp, slop, slurp, slop...Slurp, slop...

Unused Character 9: Ah, ah, you, my dear friend!
Look, find my eyes. Let's see...

Oh, it's terrible! Dear friend, it's too late, too late. Nothing to be shy about now.

...Find my eyes...Find them...

Unused Character 10: You there!
Come this way.
Could you come and help me?
I'm in trouble.

You bloody idiot!
I'll kill and skin you!

        Thank you mostly to the Bloodborne Wikia’s Out there! I used every single one of them
to find the information I got everything from. I mostly used this Bloodborne Wiki. Thanks to
Meph, Richard Pillbeam and all other Major Contributors to that Wiki for all of their hard work.
100% CHECK that one out for additional information, pictures and files for everything included

uncovering the cut content so I can put it here.

This Script is more for quick reference and basically an “All-in-One” for the community just for
